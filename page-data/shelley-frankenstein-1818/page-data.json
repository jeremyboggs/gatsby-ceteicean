In one myth, Prometheus created man, but in the\r\n                     more common myth, Prometheus protected man by tricking Zeus out of a prize\r\n                     sacrifice of meat and giving it to humans.

The Romantics placed importance in feeling and nature, and\r\n                           Milton epitomized that throughout his poem, showing the the evolution of\r\n                           human consciousness and the building up of the human spirit. The\r\n                           independence and individuality he gives to Satan creates sympathy for a\r\n                           hated stock character, redeeming him in the reader’s eyes. This in turn\r\n                           projects the idea of redemption of the spirit through internal means,\r\n                           removing the need for deliverance through an omnipotent being.

In 1791, the bookseller moved from Chiswell Street to a large\r\n                     purpose-built store in Finsbury Square, dubbed \"The Temple of the Muses\"--above\r\n                     the entrance, an inscription advertised \"The Cheapest Books in the World.\"\r\n                     Lackington's 1799-1800 catalog, according to the <tei-ref target=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lackington,_George_(DNB00)\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">Dictionary of National Biography</tei-ref>, boasted nearly 300,000 volumes\r\n                     available for sale. In 1789, the founder's cousin, George Lackington, took over\r\n                     operations, and it was here that Shelley's book was sold. <tei-ref target=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=1y3bS3Z0uY0C\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">William St. Clair,\r\n                        in <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</tei-hi>,\r\n                        describes the publication of <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Frankenstein</tei-hi></tei-ref>.\r\n                     Percy Bysshe Shelley, Shelley's husband and noted Romantic poet, arranged the\r\n                     initial printing with Lackington &amp; Co., which was known to specialize in\r\n                     books about magic and the supernatural.

The second edition, published\r\n                     in 1831, came after the loss of her husband, most of her children, and her\r\n                     family. There are many differences between the two texts, which <tei-ref target=\"http://juxtacommons.org/shares/Nme50n\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">can be viewed</tei-ref> in Dana\r\n                     Wheeles’ public Juxta collation. One of the main structural differences between\r\n                     the texts is the loss of the three volumes found in the 1818 edition. In the\r\n                     1831 edition, after the first four letters, the chapters are numbered 1-24,\r\n                     which not only removes the multiple volumes but also obscures the separated\r\n                     narratives of Victor, the Creature, and Walton. Another noticeable difference\r\n                     comes from the removal of the epigraph from Milton’s <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Paradise\r\n                        Lost</tei-hi>, which, in the beginning of the 1818 edition, announces the key\r\n                     theme of the novel. Its removal from the 1831 edition obscures the importance\r\n                     of the allusions to Milton’s work throughout the novel. In the <tei-ref target=\"https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/frankenstein/1831v1/intro\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">newly-added forward to the 1831 edition</tei-ref>, Mary Shelley wrote, somewhat\r\n                     disingenuously, \"I have changed no portion of the story, nor introduced any new\r\n                     ideas or circumstances.\" Shelley in fact makes many changes that drastically\r\n                     change the interpretation and meaning of the text. </tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">First, many of the scientific ideas written about in the 1818 edition are\r\n                     removed, detaching the novel from an intellectual context and further pressing\r\n                     it into the fantastical. Shelley also removes many of Elizabeth’s more\r\n                     independent thoughts about women’s rights as well as her indictment of the\r\n                     justice system in regards to Justine. Finally, one of the largest differences\r\n                     between the editions is Victor Frankenstein’s character. Whereas in the 1818\r\n                     edition, Victor’s own hubris is to blame for the outcome of the Creature, in\r\n                     the 1831 edition, Victor is at the mercy of fate or chance.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">To explore more about the differences between the editions, see Jill Lepore’s\r\n                     article in <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">The New Yorker</tei-hi>, <tei-ref target=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-strange-and-twisted-life-of-frankenstein\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">\"The Strange and Twisted Life of <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Frankenstein</tei-hi>\"</tei-ref>, Jacqueline Foertsch’s <tei-ref target=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1350098\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">The Right, the Wrong, and the\r\n                        Ugly: Teaching Shelley's Several \"Frankensteins\"</tei-ref>, or James O’Rourke’s\r\n                        <tei-ref target=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25601400\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">\"The 1831 Introduction\r\n                        and Revisions to <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Frankenstein</tei-hi>: Mary Shelley Dictates\r\n                        Her Legacy</tei-ref>.

Mary had a\r\n                  difficult upbringing, as her mother died shortly after her birth and her father\r\n                  remarried to Mary Jane Clairmont, who had a tenuous relationship with Mary. Mary\r\n                  was never formally educated but read many of her father’s books and was introduced\r\n                  to many influential writers like William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\r\n                  Mary, while on a trip to Scotland visiting family friends, met and fell in love\r\n                  with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who was already married and also a student of her\r\n                  father. The two eloped in 1814 and travelled around Europe. It was in Switzerland,\r\n                  with a cohort made up of the Shelleys, Jane Clairmont, Lord Byron, and John\r\n                  Polidori, where Mary first began Frankenstein one rainy afternoon during a ghost\r\n                  story writing exercise. <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Frankenstein</tei-hi> was published in 1818\r\n                  anonymously with a foreword by Percy Shelley, whom many people assumed wrote the\r\n                  novel. The novel was a huge success, and is now often considered the first science\r\n                  fiction novel. After the success of her first novel, Shelley continued to write\r\n                  but her personal life declined rapidly. She lost three children in her lifetime,\r\n                  her half-sister committed suicide, and her marriage, riddled with affairs, ended\r\n                  in 1822 when Percy Shelley drowned in the Gulf of Spezia. Mary died at 53 of brain\r\n                  cancer on February 1, 1851 in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011781\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">London</tei-placeName>, England.

A play within a play, the story\r\n                  is set in a fairyland Athenian forest during the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of\r\n                  Athens, to Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons. The play’s complex subplots\r\n                  involve a variety of complementary stories. The play opens with a love triangle\r\n                  between Hermia, who is in love with Lysander but is being forced to marry\r\n                  Demetrius by her father Egeus. Helena, Hermia’s best friend is in love with\r\n                  Demetrius. On another side of the story are the \"Rude Mechanicals,\" a group of six\r\n                  skilled laborers who are planning a performance of <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Pyramus and\r\n                     Thisbe</tei-hi>. The last subplot involves the king and queen of the fairies,\r\n                  Oberon and Titania, who are in an argument over a small child Titania is\r\n                  protecting from Oberon. Oberon, in his frustration over Titania’s disobedience,\r\n                  sends his sprite, Robin \"Puck\" Goodfellow, to create a love potion to shame\r\n                  Titania into obedience. Puck wreaks havoc on all the characters, causing the men\r\n                  to fall in love with Helena and rebuff Hermia, turning Bottom part donkey, and\r\n                  prompting Titania to fall in love with Bottom. During this confusion, Oberon\r\n                  steals the child from Titania, upon which success he orders Puck to set everything\r\n                  straight. The play concludes with the Mechanicals’ inexpert play-within-a-play,\r\n                  staged for the marriage festivities of Theseus and Hippolyta.

Deriving from the Greek word \"enthous,\" meannig possessed or\r\n                     inspired by a god, the concept of enthusiasm was linked to <tei-ref target=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Enlightening_Enthusiasm.html\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">religious fanaticism (particularly Methodism)</tei-ref> during the early\r\n                     eighteenth century and described by philosophers like Locke and Hume as an\r\n                     error in thinking that reason and reflection could correct. Enthusiasm was\r\n                     also, however, understood as the ability to \"see the truth transparently and\r\n                     spontaneously without mediation\" (Mee 8). <tei-ref target=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Romanticism_Enthusiasm_and_Regulation.html\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">Jon Mee, in <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Romanticism, Enthusiasm, and\r\n                        Regulation</tei-hi></tei-ref>, goes on to note: \"Although it was often associated\r\n                     with the sort of implosion of the self that came from the prophet retiring into\r\n                     the wilderness, a species of melancholia and gloomy introspection, it was also\r\n                     routinely construed in terms of the delirium of the senses that manifested\r\n                     itself in the mania of the crowd\" (10-11). Closely related to concepts of\r\n                     imagination and fancy, enthusiasm is a complex term that suggests many of the\r\n                     negative aspects of the Romantic sensibility. For Wordsworth and Coleridge,\r\n                     enthusiasm is a kind of corruption of or detour in the imagination (Mee 12).\r\n                  </tei-note> which elevates me to heaven; for nothing contributes so much to\r\n                  tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose,—a point on which the soul may fix its\r\n                  intellectual eye.

You may remember that a history of all the\r\n                  voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good\r\n                  uncle <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Thomas</tei-persName>'s library. My education was neglected, yet I was\r\n                  passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my\r\n                  familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on\r\n                  learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to\r\n                  embark in a sea-faring life.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose\r\n                  effusions entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven.

I must own I\r\n                  felt a little proud, when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel,\r\n                  and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so valuable did he\r\n                  consider my services.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">And now, dear <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Margaret</tei-persName>, do I not deserve to accomplish some\r\n                  great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred\r\n                  glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\r\n                  voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but\r\n                  my hopes fluctuate, <tei-pb n=\"[1.8]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/8.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> and my spirits\r\n                  are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the\r\n                  emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise\r\n                  the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when their's are\r\n                  failing.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This is the most favourable period for travelling in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002435\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Russia</tei-placeName>.

The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs,\r\n                  a dress which I have already adopted; for there is a great difference between\r\n                  walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\r\n                  prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.

I have hired a vessel, and am occupied\r\n                  in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on\r\n                  whom I can depend, and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the absence\r\n                  of the object of which I <tei-pb n=\"[1.11]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/11.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> now feel\r\n                  as a most severe evil. I have no friend, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Margaret</tei-persName>: when I am\r\n                  glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy;\r\n                  if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in\r\n                  dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor\r\n                  medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could\r\n                  sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my\r\n                  dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me,\r\n                  gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind,\r\n                  whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\r\n                  friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution, and\r\n                  too impatient of <tei-pb n=\"[1.12 - page breaks after 'difficul-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/12.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to\r\n                  me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on\r\n                  a common, and read nothing but our uncle <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Thomas</tei-persName>'s books of\r\n                  voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\r\n                  country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most\r\n                  important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity of\r\n                  becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am\r\n                  twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate than many school-boys of fifteen.\r\n                  It is true that I have thought more, and that my day dreams are more extended and\r\n                  magnificent; but they want (as the painters call it) keeping; and I greatly need a\r\n                  friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection <tei-pb n=\"[1.13]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/13.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> enough for me to endeavour to regulate my\r\n                  mind.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide\r\n                  ocean, nor even here in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011546\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Archangel</tei-placeName>,\r\n                  among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human\r\n                  nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of\r\n                  wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory. He is an\r\n                  Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened\r\n                  by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became\r\n                  acquainted with him on board a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in\r\n                  this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in <tei-pb n=\"[1.14]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/14.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the ship for his gentleness, and the\r\n                  mildness of his discipline. He is, indeed, of so amiable a nature, that he will\r\n                  not hunt (a favourite, and almost the only amusement here), because he cannot\r\n                  endure to spill blood. He is, moreover, heroically generous. Some years ago he\r\n                  loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and having amassed a considerable\r\n                  sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his\r\n                  mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and,\r\n                  throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same\r\n                  time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never\r\n                  consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being\r\n                  informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had <tei-pb n=\"[1.15]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/15.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> already bought a farm with his\r\n                  money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed\r\n                  the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase\r\n                  stock, and then himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to her\r\n                  marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound\r\n                  in honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his\r\n                  country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married\r\n                  according to her inclinations. <tei-said who=\"#margaretWalton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"What a noble\r\n                     fellow!\"</tei-said> you will exclaim. He is so; but then he has passed all his life\r\n                  on board a vessel, and has scarcely an idea beyond the rope and the shroud.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But do not suppose that, because I complain a little, or because I can conceive a\r\n                  consolation for my toils which I <tei-pb n=\"[1.16]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/16.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate;\r\n                  and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.\r\n                  The winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and it is\r\n                  considered as a remarkably early season; so that, perhaps, I may sail sooner than\r\n                  I expected. I shall do nothing rashly; you know me sufficiently to confide in my\r\n                  prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my\r\n                  care.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.

The luck of the ship\r\n                     dissipates, and they are becalmed on the ocean. The Mariner watches as each of\r\n                     the sailors die of thirst, while he alone is saved. This direct allusion\r\n                     highlights the similarities between the Mariner and Frankenstein, who are both\r\n                     reeling after accomplishing their respective goals--killing the albatross and\r\n                     creating a sentient being--and both in the process of telling their stories.\r\n                     The use of the quote is two-fold; it highlights Frankenstein’s isolation and\r\n                     his decision to abandon his creature, but it also juxtaposes the Mariner’s\r\n                     violence with Frankenstein’s act of creation.

Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed\r\n                     round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some <tei-pb n=\"[1.22]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/22.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> change would take place in the\r\n                     atmosphere and weather.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every\r\n                     direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some\r\n                     of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious\r\n                     thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted\r\n                     our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a\r\n                     sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a\r\n                     mile: a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\r\n                     sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the\r\n                     traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities\r\n                     of the ice.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[1.23]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/23.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many\r\n                     hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was\r\n                     not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it\r\n                     was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest\r\n                     attention.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before\r\n                     night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning,\r\n                     fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about\r\n                     after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few\r\n                     hours.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon the deck, and\r\n                     found all the sailors busy on one side <tei-pb n=\"[1.24]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/24.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> of the vessel, apparently talking to some\r\n                     one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which\r\n                     had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog\r\n                     remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were\r\n                     persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to\r\n                     be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an European. When I\r\n                     appeared on deck, the master said, <tei-said who=\"#master\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Here is our captain,\r\n                        and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign\r\n                     accent. <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Before I come on board your vessel,\"</tei-said> said\r\n                     he, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"will you have the kindness to inform me whither you\r\n                        are bound?\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">You may conceive my astonishment <tei-pb n=\"[1.25]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/25.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of\r\n                     destruction, and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been\r\n                     a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the\r\n                     earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery\r\n                     towards the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1112230\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">northern pole</tei-placeName>.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good\r\n                     God! <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Margaret</tei-persName>, if you had seen the man who thus\r\n                     capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs\r\n                     were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.\r\n                     I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into\r\n                     the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We\r\n                     accordingly <tei-pb n=\"[1.26]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/26.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> brought him back to\r\n                     the deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing\r\n                     him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped\r\n                     him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen-stove. By\r\n                     slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him\r\n                     wonderfully.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared\r\n                     that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some\r\n                     measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much\r\n                     as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have\r\n                     generally an expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments\r\n                     when, if any-one performs an act of kindness <tei-pb n=\"[1.27]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/27.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> towards him, or does him any the most\r\n                     trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam\r\n                     of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally\r\n                     melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient\r\n                     of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men,\r\n                     who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be\r\n                     tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose\r\n                     restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the\r\n                     lieutenant asked, <tei-said who=\"#lieutenant\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Why he had come so far upon the ice\r\n                        in so strange a vehicle?\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he <tei-pb n=\"[1.28]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/28.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> replied, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"To\r\n                        seek one who fled from me.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#walton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same\r\n                        fashion?\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Yes.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#walton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we\r\n                        picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across\r\n                        the ice.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a multitude of questions\r\n                     concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon\r\n                     after, when he was alone with me, he said, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I have,\r\n                        doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but\r\n                        you are too considerate to make inquiries.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#walton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman\r\n                        in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[1.29]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/29.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous\r\n                        situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Soon after this <tei-said who=\"#victor\" aloud=\"false\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"aloud who\">he inquired, if I thought\r\n                        that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge?</tei-said>\r\n                     <tei-said who=\"#walton\" aloud=\"false\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"aloud who\">I replied, that I could not answer with any\r\n                        degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the\r\n                        traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of\r\n                        this I could not judge.</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">From this time the stranger seemed very eager to be upon deck, to watch for the\r\n                     sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the\r\n                     cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. But I\r\n                     have promised that some one should watch for him, and give him instant notice\r\n                     if any new object should appear in sight.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[1.30]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/30.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present\r\n                     day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is very silent, and\r\n                     appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin.

He excites at once my admiration\r\n                     and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature\r\n                     destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle,\r\n                     yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words\r\n                     are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled\r\n                     eloquence.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck,\r\n                     apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although <tei-pb n=\"[1.32 - page breaks after 'un-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/32.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests\r\n                     himself deeply in the employments of others. He has asked me many questions\r\n                     concerning my design; and I have related my little history frankly to him. He\r\n                     appeared pleased with the confidence, and suggested several alterations in my\r\n                     plan, which I shall find exceedingly useful. There is no pedantry in his\r\n                     manner; but all he does appears to spring solely from the interest he\r\n                     instinctively takes in the welfare of those who surround him. He is often\r\n                     overcome by gloom, and then he sits by himself, and tries to overcome all that\r\n                     is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms pass from him like a cloud\r\n                     from before the sun, though his dejection never leaves him. I have endeavoured\r\n                     to win his confidence; and I trust that I have <tei-pb n=\"[1.33 - page breaks after 'suc-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/33.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     succeeded.

Her imagination was luxuriant, yet her capability of\r\n                     application was great. Her person was the image of her mind; her hazel eyes,\r\n                     although as lively as a bird's, possessed an attractive softness.

For William Wordsworth, fancy is, like the imagination, a force for\r\n                        association and creation; in his Preface of 1815, he writes that fancy is\r\n                        \"capricious as the accidents of things... Fancy depends upon the rapidity\r\n                        and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images\" (<tei-ref target=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3APoems_by_William_Wordsworth_(1815)_Volume_1.djvu/42\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">xxxiv</tei-ref>-<tei-ref target=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Poems_by_William_Wordsworth_(1815)_Volume_1.djvu/43\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">xxxv</tei-ref>).

For Coleridge, fancy is inferior to imagination, lighter,\r\n                        and is more like wit in terms of its power to make connections between\r\n                        ideas; Coleridge explores the distinctions between primary imagination,\r\n                        secondary imagination, and fancy in Book 13 of <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Biographia\r\n                           Literaria</tei-hi> (1817).

Chivalry, in particular, refers to \"an idealized code of\r\n                        civilized behaviour that combines loyalty, honour, and courtly love.\" These\r\n                        sorts of stories were often called \"romans,\" from which the word \"romance\"\r\n                        derives.

A student of many disciplines, influenced by Aristotle, and\r\n                        a prolific writer, he composed <tei-ref target=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Albertus-Magnus\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">38\r\n                           volumes</tei-ref> encompassing many topics such as logic, theology, botany,\r\n                        geography, astronomy, astrology, mineralogy, alchemy, zoology, physiology,\r\n                        phrenology, justice, and law. Albertus’ work represents the entire body of\r\n                        theological and philosophical knowledge during his time. His influence on\r\n                        natural science is most important as he brought Aristotelian knowledge of\r\n                        nature to the forefront as well as increasing knowledge through his\r\n                        experiments promoting the idea that Christian faith and experimental science\r\n                        were not hostile to one another.

In Experiment 41, Boyle placed birds, mice, and other small\r\n                        creatures into the air pump and slowly removed the air to prove the\r\n                        necessity of respiration. While watching a lark in one reiteration of the\r\n                        experiment, he observed: \"…the Bird for a while appear'd lively enough; but\r\n                        upon a greater Exsuction of the Air, she began manifestly to droop and\r\n                        appear sick, and very soon after was taken with as violent and irregular\r\n                        Convulsions, as are wont to be observ'd in Poultry, when their heads are\r\n                        wrung off: For the Bird threw her self over and over two or three times, and\r\n                        dyed with her Breast upward, her Head downwards, and her Neck awry\" (cite\r\n                        page 98). These experiments intrigued the public. Joseph Wright’s\r\n                        (1734-1797) oil paintings imagined these experiments as subjects of\r\n                        middle-class, domestic education.

The Jura are a range of mountains\r\n                        in the northwest following the France-Switzerland border forming the\r\n                        watersheds for both the Rhone and Rhine basins.

Montanvert is\r\n                        also part of the Alps, but is the eighteenth-century name for Mer de Glace,\r\n                        a glacier on the Mont Blanc massif. <tei-ref target=\"https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/landscape-and-the-sublime\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">Romantic artists--including Percy Shelley, Coleridge, J.M.W.

When we visited it the\r\n                     next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.

Ben Franklin was a contemporary of Mary\r\n                        Shelley’s parents, and he influenced the world of politics, culture, and\r\n                        science. Well-known inventing bifocals, Franklin is also associated in the\r\n                        popular imagination with his electrical experiments involving keys, storms,\r\n                        and kites. Contrary to popular belief, Franklin did not discover\r\n                        electricity, but he connected electrical conduits through substances like\r\n                        water and metal, and he understood that electricity can be held and\r\n                        discharged.

Franklin’s experiments with electricity were\r\n                        the precursor to Galvani’s and Volta’s experiments with electricity and\r\n                        galvanism. These two scientists sought to prove that electricity could\r\n                        animate deceased matter, namely frogs, but went so far as to momentarily\r\n                        animate the bodies of beheaded criminals.

During her confinement, many\r\n                     arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon\r\n                     her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that her\r\n                     favourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her society,\r\n                     and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past.

It is so long before the mind can\r\n                     persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and whose very existence <tei-pb n=\"[1.64]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/64.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> appeared a part of our own, can\r\n                     have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\r\n                     extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be\r\n                     hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days;\r\n                     but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual\r\n                     bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away\r\n                     some dear connexion; and why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt,\r\n                     and must feel? The time at length arrives, when grief is rather an indulgence\r\n                     than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be\r\n                     deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still\r\n                     duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest,\r\n                     and learn to think <tei-pb n=\"[1.65]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/65.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> ourselves\r\n                     fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My journey to <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7017035\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Ingolstadt</tei-placeName>, which\r\n                     had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained\r\n                     from my father a respite of some weeks. This period was spent sadly; my\r\n                     mother's death, and my speedy departure, depressed our spirits; but\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> endeavoured to renew the spirit of\r\n                     cheerfulness in our little society. Since the death of her aunt, her mind had\r\n                     acquired new firmness and vigour. She determined to fulfil her duties with the\r\n                     greatest exactness; and she felt that that most imperious duty, of rendering\r\n                     her uncle and cousins happy, had devolved upon her. She consoled me, amused her\r\n                     uncle, instructed my brothers; and I never beheld her so enchanting as at this\r\n                     time, when she was continually endeavouring to <tei-pb n=\"[1.66 - page breaks after 'con-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/66.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     contribute to the happiness of others, entirely forgetful of herself.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The day of my departure at length arrived.

Tears gushed from the eyes of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>;\r\n                     they proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure, and partly because she\r\n                     reflected that the same journey was to have taken place three months before,\r\n                     when a mother's blessing would have accompanied me.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in the\r\n                     most melancholy reflections.

In the university, whither I was going, I must form my own\r\n                     friends, and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded\r\n                     and domestic; and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.\r\n                     I loved my brothers, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, and\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>; <tei-pb n=\"[1.68]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/68.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     these were <tei-ref target=\"Old_Familiar_Faces_\" corresp=\"Old_Familiar_Faces\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"corresp target\">\r\n                        <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\"old familiar faces;\"</tei-quote></tei-ref>\r\n                     <tei-note xml:id=\"Old_Familiar_Faces\" id=\"Old_Familiar_Faces\" target=\"Old_Familiar_Faces_\" type=\"editorial\" resp=\"editors.xml#AF\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type target xml:id\">This is a direct allusion to Charles Lamb’s\r\n                        (1775-1834) poem, <tei-ref target=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44519/the-old-familiar-faces\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">\"Old Familiar Faces\"</tei-ref>, a poem about Lamb looking back on his life\r\n                        through the lens of nostalgia.

I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth\r\n                     cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the world, and take my station\r\n                     among other human beings.

I attended the lectures, and\r\n                     cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the university; and I\r\n                     found even in <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Krempe</tei-persName> a great deal of sound sense and\r\n                     real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and\r\n                     manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M.\r\n                        Waldman</tei-persName> I found <tei-pb n=\"[1.79]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/79.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> a\r\n                     true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions\r\n                     were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of\r\n                     pedantry. It was, perhaps, the amiable character of this man that inclined me\r\n                     more to that branch of natural philosophy which he professed, than an intrinsic\r\n                     love for the science itself. But this state of mind had place only in the first\r\n                     steps towards knowledge: the more fully I entered into the science, the more\r\n                     exclusively I pursued it for its own sake. That application, which at first had\r\n                     been a matter of duty and resolution, now became so ardent and eager, that the\r\n                     stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my\r\n                     laboratory.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that I improved <tei-pb n=\"[1.80 - page breaks after 'ra-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/80.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     rapidly. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students; and my\r\n                     proficiency, that of the masters. Professor <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Krempe</tei-persName> often\r\n                     asked me, with a sly smile, how <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n80043375\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Cornelius Agrippa</tei-persName> went on? whilst <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M.\r\n                        Waldman</tei-persName> expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.\r\n                     Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>, but was engaged, heart and\r\n                     soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make. None but those\r\n                     who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In other\r\n                     studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more\r\n                     to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and\r\n                     wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely pursues one study, must\r\n                     infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who <tei-pb n=\"[1.81 - page breaks after 'con-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/81.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit, and was solely\r\n                     wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made\r\n                     some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which\r\n                     procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I had arrived\r\n                     at this point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice\r\n                     of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7017035\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Ingolstadt</tei-placeName>, my residence\r\n                     there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to\r\n                     my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my\r\n                     stay.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">One of the phænomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the\r\n                     structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence,\r\n                     I often asked myself, did the <tei-pb n=\"[1.82]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/82.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been\r\n                     considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of\r\n                     becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\r\n                     inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined\r\n                     thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural\r\n                     philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost\r\n                     supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome,\r\n                     and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have\r\n                     recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this\r\n                     was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the\r\n                     human body. In my education my father had taken the <tei-pb n=\"[1.83]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/83.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> greatest precautions that my mind should be\r\n                     impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled\r\n                     at a tale of superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.\r\n                     Darkness had no effect upon my fancy; and a churchyard was to me merely the\r\n                     receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and\r\n                     strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and\r\n                     progress of this decay, and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\r\n                     charnel houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable\r\n                     to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was\r\n                     degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming\r\n                     cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I\r\n                        <tei-pb n=\"[1.84]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/84.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> paused, examining and\r\n                     analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life\r\n                     to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden\r\n                     light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that\r\n                     while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I\r\n                     was surprised that among so many men of genius, who had directed their\r\n                     inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover\r\n                     so astonishing a secret.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more\r\n                     certainly shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is true. Some\r\n                     miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct\r\n                     and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, <tei-pb n=\"[1.85]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/85.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> I succeeded in discovering the\r\n                     cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\r\n                     animation upon lifeless matter.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave\r\n                     place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to\r\n                     arrive at once at the summit of my desires, was the most gratifying\r\n                     consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming,\r\n                     that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were\r\n                     obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire\r\n                     of the wisest men since the creation of the world, was now within my grasp. Not\r\n                     that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had\r\n                     obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should\r\n                     point them towards <tei-pb n=\"[1.86]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/86.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the object of\r\n                     my search, than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the\r\n                     Arabian who had been buried with the dead, and found a passage to life aided\r\n                     only by one glimmering, and seemingly ineffectual, light.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my\r\n                     friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am\r\n                     acquainted; that cannot be: listen patiently until the end of my story, and you\r\n                     will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you\r\n                     on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible\r\n                     misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how\r\n                     dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who\r\n                     believes his <tei-pb n=\"[1.87]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/87.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> native town to be\r\n                     the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will\r\n                     allow.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long\r\n                     time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed\r\n                     the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception\r\n                     of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a\r\n                     work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I\r\n                     should attempt the creation of a being like myself or one of simpler\r\n                     organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to\r\n                     permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and\r\n                     wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\r\n                     adequate to so arduous an <tei-pb n=\"[1.88]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/88.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     undertaking; but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared\r\n                     myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled,\r\n                     and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I considered the improvement which\r\n                     every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my\r\n                     present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\r\n                     could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its\r\n                     impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a\r\n                     human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my\r\n                     speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a\r\n                     gigantic stature; that is to say, about eight feet in height, and\r\n                     proportionably large. After having formed this <tei-pb n=\"[1.89 - page breaks after 'de-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/89.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     determination, and having spent some months in successfully collecting and\r\n                     arranging my materials, I began.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a\r\n                     hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me\r\n                     ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light\r\n                     into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source;\r\n                     many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could\r\n                     claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve their's.\r\n                     Pursuing these reflections, I thought, that if I could bestow animation upon\r\n                     lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it\r\n                     impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to\r\n                     corruption.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[1.90]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/90.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with\r\n                     unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had\r\n                     become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I\r\n                     failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might\r\n                     realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had\r\n                     dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with\r\n                     unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who\r\n                     shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed\r\n                     damps of the grave, or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?\r\n                     My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a\r\n                     resistless, and almost frantic impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to <tei-pb n=\"[1.91]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/91.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> have lost all soul or sensation\r\n                     but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me\r\n                     feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to\r\n                     operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel\r\n                     houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the\r\n                     human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\r\n                     and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept\r\n                     my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in\r\n                     attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the\r\n                     slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature\r\n                     turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness\r\n                     which perpetually increased, <tei-pb n=\"[1.92]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/92.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> I\r\n                     brought my work near to a conclusion.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one\r\n                     pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more\r\n                     plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes\r\n                     were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me\r\n                     neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so\r\n                     many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my\r\n                     silence disquieted them; and I well remembered the words of my father: <tei-said who=\"#father\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I know that while you are pleased with yourself, you will\r\n                        think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.

I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all\r\n                     that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which\r\n                     swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to\r\n                     vice, or faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was justified in\r\n                     conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in\r\n                     perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to\r\n                     allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. <tei-pb n=\"[1.94]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/94.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> I do not think that the pursuit\r\n                     of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply\r\n                     yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste\r\n                     for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study\r\n                     is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this\r\n                     rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to\r\n                     interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000074\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Greece</tei-placeName> had not been enslaved; <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n79021400\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Caesar</tei-persName> would have spared his\r\n                     country; <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"8698314\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">America</tei-placeName> would have\r\n                     been discovered more gradually; and the empires of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7005560\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mexico</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000056\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Peru</tei-placeName> had not been destroyed.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale; and\r\n                     your looks remind me to proceed.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My father made no reproach in his <tei-pb n=\"[1.95]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/95.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> letters; and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations\r\n                     more particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my\r\n                     labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which\r\n                     before always yielded me supreme delight, so deeply was I engrossed in my\r\n                     occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a\r\n                     close; and now every day shewed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But\r\n                     my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed\r\n                     by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade, than an artist\r\n                     occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow\r\n                     fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; a disease that I\r\n                     regretted the more because I had hitherto <tei-pb n=\"[1.96 - page breaks after 'en-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/96.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> enjoyed\r\n                     most excellent health, and had always boasted of the firmness of my nerves. But\r\n                     I believed that exercise and amusement would soon drive away such symptoms; and\r\n                     I promised myself both of these, when my creation should be\r\n                  complete.</tei-p></tei-said>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </tei-div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <tei-div n=\"1.4\" type=\"chapter\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"type n\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[1.97]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/97.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-head data-origname=\"head\">Chapter IV</tei-head>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\"><tei-p data-origname=\"p\">IT was on a dreary night of <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">November</tei-date>, that I\r\n                     beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to\r\n                     agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\r\n                     spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one\r\n                     in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was\r\n                     nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw\r\n                     the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed <tei-pb n=\"[1.98]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/98.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its\r\n                     limbs.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch\r\n                     whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?

His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and\r\n                     arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a\r\n                     pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with\r\n                     his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets\r\n                     in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and straight black lips.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human\r\n                     nature.

I had desired it with an\r\n                     ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of\r\n                     the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable\r\n                     to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room, and\r\n                     continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to\r\n                     sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I\r\n                     threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of\r\n                     forgetfulness. But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by the\r\n                     wildest dreams. I thought I saw <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, in the bloom of\r\n                     health, walking in the streets of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7017035\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Ingolstadt</tei-placeName>. Delighted and surprised, I <tei-pb n=\"[1.100 - page breaks after 'em-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/100.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     embraced her; but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid\r\n                     with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\r\n                     held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and\r\n                     I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my\r\n                     sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and\r\n                     every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as\r\n                     it forced its way through the window-shutters, I beheld the wretch—the\r\n                     miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and\r\n                     his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he\r\n                     muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might\r\n                     have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was <tei-pb n=\"[1.101]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/101.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but\r\n                     I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard belonging to\r\n                     the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night,\r\n                     walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching\r\n                     and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal\r\n                     corpse to which I had so miserably given life.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again\r\n                     endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on\r\n                     him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were\r\n                     rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n78095495\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Dante</tei-persName>\r\n                      could not have\r\n                     conceived.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and <tei-pb n=\"[1.102]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/102.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> hardly, that I felt the\r\n                     palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through\r\n                     languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness\r\n                     of disappointment: dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a\r\n                     space, were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow\r\n                     so complete!</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and\r\n                     aching eyes the church of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7017035\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Ingolstadt</tei-placeName>, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the\r\n                     sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been\r\n                     my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I\r\n                     sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would\r\n                     present to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited,\r\n                     but felt <tei-pb n=\"[1.103]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/103.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> impelled to hurry on,\r\n                     although wetted by the rain, which poured from a black and comfortless sky.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily\r\n                     exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets,\r\n                     without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart\r\n                     palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not\r\n                     daring to look about me:</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\r\n                     <tei-lg data-origname=\"lg\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-l data-origname=\"l\">Like one who, on a lonely road,</tei-l>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-l data-origname=\"l\">Doth walk in fear and dread,</tei-l>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-l data-origname=\"l\">And, having once turn'd round, walks on,</tei-l>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-l data-origname=\"l\">And turns no more his head;</tei-l>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-l data-origname=\"l\">Because he knows a frightful fiend</tei-l>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-l data-origname=\"l\">Doth close behind him tread.*</tei-l>\r\n\r\n\r\n                     </tei-lg>\r\n                  </tei-quote>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\r\n                     diligences and carriages usually stopped. <tei-pb n=\"[1.104]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/104.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> Here I paused, I knew not why; but I\r\n                     remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me\r\n                     from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer, I observed that it was the\r\n                     Swiss diligence: it stopped just where I was standing; and, on the door being\r\n                     opened, I perceived <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry Clerval</tei-persName>, who, on seeing me,\r\n                     instantly sprung out. <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"My dear\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Frankenstein</tei-persName>,\"</tei-said> exclaimed he, <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"how glad I am to see you! how fortunate that you should be\r\n                        here at the very moment of my alighting!\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Nothing could equal my delight on seeing <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>; his\r\n                     presence brought back to my thoughts my father, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>,\r\n                     and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand,\r\n                     and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the\r\n                     first time during many months, <tei-pb n=\"[1.105]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/105.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend therefore, in the most cordial\r\n                     manner, and we walked towards my college. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>\r\n                     continued talking for some time about our mutual friends, and his own good\r\n                     fortune in being permitted to come to <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7017035\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Ingolstadt</tei-placeName>. <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"You may easily\r\n                        believe,\"</tei-said> said he, <tei-said data-origname=\"said\">\"how great was the difficulty to persuade my\r\n                        father that it was not absolutely necessary for a merchant not to understand\r\n                        any thing except book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous\r\n                        to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same\r\n                        as that of the Dutch school-master in the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Vicar of Wakefield</tei-title>:\r\n                           <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I\r\n                           eat heartily without Greek.\"</tei-said> But his affection for me at length\r\n                        overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake <tei-pb n=\"[1.106]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/106.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> a voyage of discovery to the\r\n                        land of knowledge.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me\r\n                        how you left my father, brothers, and\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they\r\n                        hear from you so seldom.

I walked with a quick pace, and we\r\n                     soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver,\r\n                     that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive,\r\n                     and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more\r\n                     that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry</tei-persName> should see him. Entreating him therefore to\r\n                     remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own\r\n                     room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.\r\n                     I then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly\r\n                     open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\r\n                     waiting for them on the other side; but nothing <tei-pb n=\"[1.108]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/108.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the\r\n                     apartment was empty; and my bed-room was also freed from its hideous guest. I\r\n                     could hardly believe that so great a good-fortune could have befallen me; but\r\n                     when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for\r\n                     joy, and ran down to <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I\r\n                     was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my\r\n                     flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was\r\n                     unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the\r\n                     chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName> at\r\n                     first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival; but when he observed\r\n                     me more attentively, he saw a wildness in <tei-pb n=\"[1.109]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/109.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> my eyes for which he could not account; and\r\n                     my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter, frightened and astonished him.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"My dear <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Victor</tei-persName>,\"</tei-said> cried he,\r\n                        <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"what, for God's sake, is the matter?

But I\r\n                     was not the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my\r\n                     senses for a long, long time.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[1.110]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/110.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This was the commencement of a nervous fever, which confined me for several\r\n                     months. During all that time <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry</tei-persName> was my only nurse. I\r\n                     afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age, and unfitness for so\r\n                     long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, he spared them this grief by concealing the\r\n                     extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\r\n                     nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not\r\n                     doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he\r\n                     could towards them.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and\r\n                     unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of\r\n                     the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before <tei-pb n=\"[1.111]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/111.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> my eyes, and I raved\r\n                     incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry</tei-persName>: he at first believed them to be the wanderings\r\n                     of my disturbed imagination; but the pertinacity with which I continually\r\n                     recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its\r\n                     origin to some uncommon and terrible event.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my\r\n                     friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing\r\n                     outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves\r\n                     had disappeared, and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees\r\n                     that shaded my window. It was a divine spring; and the season contributed\r\n                     greatly to my convalescence.

His constant illness when\r\n                           young has deprived him of the habits of application; and now that he\r\n                           enjoys good health, he is continually in the open air, climbing the\r\n                           hills, or rowing on the lake. I therefore proposed that he should be a\r\n                           farmer; which you know, Cousin, is a favourite scheme of mine. A farmer's\r\n                           is a very healthy happy life; and the least hurtful, or rather the most\r\n                           beneficial profession of any. My uncle had an idea of his being educated\r\n                           as an advocate, that through his interest he might become a judge. But,\r\n                           besides that he is not at all fitted for such an occupation, it is\r\n                           certainly more creditable to cultivate the earth for the sustenance of\r\n                           man, than to be the confidant, and sometimes the accomplice, of his\r\n                           vices; which is <tei-pb n=\"[1.117]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/117.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the\r\n                           profession of a lawyer. I said, that the employments of a prosperous\r\n                           farmer, if they were not a more honourable, they were at least a happier\r\n                           species of occupation than that of a judge, whose misfortune it was\r\n                           always to meddle with the dark side of human nature. My uncle smiled, and\r\n                           said, that I ought to be an advocate myself, which put an end to the\r\n                           conversation on that subject.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">And now I must tell you a story that will please, and perhaps amuse you.\r\n                           Do you not remember <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine Moritz</tei-persName>? Probably you do\r\n                           not; I will relate her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Moritz</tei-persName>, her mother, was a widow with four\r\n                           children, of whom <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> was the third. This girl\r\n                           had always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange\r\n                           perversity, her mother could not endure <tei-pb n=\"[1.118]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/118.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> her, and, after the death of M.\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Moritz</tei-persName>, treated her very ill. My aunt observed\r\n                           this; and, when <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> was twelve years of age,\r\n                           prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at her house. The republican\r\n                           institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners\r\n                           than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence\r\n                           there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants;\r\n                           and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners\r\n                           are more refined and moral. A servant in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> does not mean the same thing as a\r\n                           servant in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000070\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">France</tei-placeName> and\r\n                              <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002445\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">England</tei-placeName>.\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName>, thus received in our family, learned the\r\n                           duties of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does\r\n                           not include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a\r\n                           human being.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-pb n=\"[1.119]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/119.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After what I have said, I dare say you well remember the heroine of my\r\n                           little tale: for <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> was a great favourite of\r\n                           your's; and I recollect you once remarked, that if you were in an ill\r\n                           humour, one glance from <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> could dissipate it,\r\n                           for the same reason that <tei-ref target=\"Ariosto_\" corresp=\"Ariosto\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"corresp target\">\r\n                              <tei-persName type=\"n79041715\" key=\"n79041715\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\"> Ariosto </tei-persName>\r\n                           </tei-ref> gives concerning the beauty of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Angelica</tei-persName>\r\n                           <tei-note xml:id=\"Ariosto\" id=\"Ariosto\" target=\"Ariosto_\" type=\"editorial\" resp=\"editors.xml#AF\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type target xml:id\">\r\n                              <tei-graphic url=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN01270/AN01270858_001_l.jpg\" data-origname=\"graphic\" data-origatts=\"url\" data-empty=\"\"/> Victor references <tei-ref target=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludovico-Ariosto\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">Ludovico Ariosto (1474-1533)</tei-ref>, an Italian poet from the 16th\r\n                              century, when talking about Justine’s \"frank-hearted and happy\"\r\n                              expression.

While it is not clear\r\n                              that this is \"the reason…[for] the beauty of Angelica,\" Ita Mac Carthy\r\n                              points out in <tei-ref target=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=HNKB32q1dJoC\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\"><tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Women and the Making of Poetry in Ariosto's\r\n                                    Orlando Furioso</tei-hi></tei-ref> (Chapter 3) that Angelica is the\r\n                              \"supreme object of [unattainable] desire\" who repeatedly flees sexual\r\n                              pursuit and generates the narrative of the poem. Her beauty is\r\n                              described as angelic, and capable of making her suitors--like the\r\n                              titular Orlando--lose their wits. In Ariosto’s epic romance, Angelica\r\n                              is a pagan princess besought by many knights. The image here shows a\r\n                              scene from <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">Orlando Furioso</tei-hi> of a man bending\r\n                              over and holding the hand of a woman, presumably Angelica, who sits on\r\n                              the ground beneath a tree, the trunk inscribed \"ANCE MEDO,\" created by\r\n                              Angelica Kauffman (1740-1807) and hosted by the British museum.\r\n                           </tei-note>—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great\r\n                           attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education\r\n                           superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully\r\n                           repaid; <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> was the most grateful little\r\n                           creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions, I\r\n                           never heard one pass her lips; but you could see by her eyes that she\r\n                           almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay, and in\r\n                           many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the <tei-pb n=\"[1.120]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/120.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> greatest attention to every gesture\r\n                           of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence, and endeavoured\r\n                           to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often\r\n                           reminds me of her.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When my dearest aunt died, everyone was too much occupied in their own\r\n                           grief to notice poor <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName>, who had attended her\r\n                           during her illness with the most anxious affection.

The conscience\r\n                           of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her\r\n                           favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was\r\n                           a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed <tei-pb n=\"[1.121]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/121.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the idea which she had conceived.\r\n                           Accordingly, a few months after your departure for <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7017035\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Ingolstadt</tei-placeName>, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> was\r\n                           called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! she wept when she quitted\r\n                           our house: she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had\r\n                           given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before\r\n                           been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother's house\r\n                           of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in\r\n                           her repentance. She sometimes begged <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> to\r\n                           forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the\r\n                           deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw\r\n                           Madame <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Moritz</tei-persName> into a decline, which at first\r\n                           increased her irritability, but she is now at peace forever. She died on\r\n                           the first approach of cold <tei-pb n=\"[1.122 - page breaks after 'wea']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/122.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> weather, at the beginning of this\r\n                           last winter. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> has returned to us; and I\r\n                           assure you I love her tenderly.

In another fortnight I was able to leave my\r\n                     chamber.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName> to the several professors of the university. In\r\n                     doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my\r\n                     mind had sustained. Ever since the <tei-pb n=\"[1.125]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/125.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\r\n                     beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the\r\n                     name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the\r\n                     sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous\r\n                     symptoms. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry</tei-persName> saw this, and had removed all my apparatus\r\n                     from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had\r\n                     acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But\r\n                     these cares of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName> were made of no avail when I\r\n                     visited the professors. M. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Waldman</tei-persName> inflicted torture when\r\n                     he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in\r\n                     the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but, not guessing\r\n                     the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and <tei-pb n=\"[1.126]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/126.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> changed the subject from my improvement to\r\n                     the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\r\n                     could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed\r\n                     carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards\r\n                     used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet\r\n                     dared not exhibit the pain I felt. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>, whose eyes and\r\n                     feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the\r\n                     subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a\r\n                     more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I\r\n                     saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret\r\n                     from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\r\n                     that knew no <tei-pb n=\"[1.127]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/127.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> bounds, yet I\r\n                     could never persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often\r\n                     present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only\r\n                     impress more deeply.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">M. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Krempe</tei-persName> was not equally docile; and in my condition at\r\n                     that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums\r\n                     gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M.\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Waldman</tei-persName>. <tei-said who=\"#krempe\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"D--n the fellow!\"</tei-said>\r\n                     cried he; <tei-said who=\"#krempe\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"why, M. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>, I assure\r\n                        you he has outstript us all.

Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my\r\n                     fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>\r\n                     called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the\r\n                     aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how\r\n                     sincerely did you love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind, until it was on a\r\n                     level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your\r\n                     gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy\r\n                     creature who, <tei-pb n=\"[1.132]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/132.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> a few years ago,\r\n                     loving and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature\r\n                     had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky\r\n                     and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed\r\n                     divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were\r\n                     already in bud: I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year\r\n                     had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\r\n                     invincible burden.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry</tei-persName> rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathized in\r\n                     my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations\r\n                     that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\r\n                     astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\r\n                     imitation <tei-pb n=\"[1.133]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/133.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> of the Persian and\r\n                     Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other\r\n                     times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he\r\n                     supported with great ingenuity.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing,\r\n                     and every one we met appeared gay and happy.

The evening was <tei-pb n=\"[1.136]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/136.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> warm and serene, and we prolonged our\r\n                           walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\r\n                           returning; and then we discovered that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName> and\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName>, who had gone on before, were not to be\r\n                           found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.\r\n                           Presently <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName> came, and inquired if we had seen\r\n                           his brother: he said, that they had been playing together, that\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName> had run away to hide himself, and that he\r\n                           vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for him a long time, but\r\n                           that he did not return.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until\r\n                           night fell, when <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> conjectured that he might\r\n                           have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\r\n                           torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet <tei-pb n=\"[1.137]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/137.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> boy had lost himself, and\r\n                           was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> also suffered extreme anguish. About\r\n                           five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I\r\n                           had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and\r\n                           motionless: the print of the murderer's finger was on his neck.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance\r\n                           betrayed the secret to <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>. She was very\r\n                           earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her; but she\r\n                           persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck\r\n                           of the victim, and clasping her hands, exclaimed, O God! I have murdered\r\n                           my darling infant!</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\r\n                           lived, it was only to weep and sigh. <tei-pb n=\"[1.138]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/138.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> She told me that that same evening\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName> had teazed her to let him wear a very\r\n                           valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is\r\n                           gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the\r\n                           deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to\r\n                           discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName>.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Come, dearest <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Victor</tei-persName>; you alone can console\r\n                              <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>.

Romanticism has little to do with feelings of romance and more\r\n                        to do with a philosophical way of thinking that prioritizes imagination,\r\n                        nature, and the self. Romanticism began in England and Germany (two\r\n                        countries not home to the romance languages begotten from Vulgar Latin),\r\n                        most notably with the poets <tei-ref target=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/william-wordsworth\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">William\r\n                           Wordsworth</tei-ref>, <tei-ref target=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">John\r\n                           Keats</tei-ref>, <tei-ref target=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-Taylor-Coleridge\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</tei-ref>, and <tei-ref target=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johann-Wolfgang-von-Goethe\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</tei-ref>. The early Romantic period is one of\r\n                        revolutionary thought heavily influenced with the American and French\r\n                        revolutions. These revolutions are important to note as they changed the\r\n                        political and individual structure and thought of their countries,\r\n                        overthrowing monarchies and creating democracies. The Romantics valued\r\n                        imagination over reason as the imagination was the primary method of\r\n                        creation. Nature, to the Romantics, was a work of art created by the divine\r\n                        imagination, full of symbolism and meaning.

However, nature is also beautiful and could only\r\n                        be created by a higher power, so while it mimics Victor’s interior state of\r\n                        duress, it is also a reminder that something is a more powerful and a better\r\n                        creator than Victor, whose creation is “grotesque\" and “malformed.\" To learn\r\n                        more about Romanticism, read Glen Levin Swiggett’s article <tei-ref target=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27530553\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">\"What is\r\n                           Romanticism?\"</tei-ref> or explore the <tei-ref target=\"https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/themes/romanticism\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">British Library’s resources on Romanticism</tei-ref>.</tei-note><tei-pb n=\"[1.147]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/147.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> and exclaimed aloud, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName>, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy\r\n                        dirge!\"</tei-said> As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure\r\n                     which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing\r\n                     intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object,\r\n                     and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity\r\n                     of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me\r\n                     that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he\r\n                     there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?\r\n                     No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its\r\n                     truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.\r\n                     The figure passed me quickly, and I lost <tei-pb n=\"[1.148]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/148.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape\r\n                     could have destroyed that fair child. He was the murderer! I could not doubt\r\n                     it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I\r\n                     thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another\r\n                     flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular\r\n                     ascent of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1106285\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mont Salêve</tei-placeName>, a hill\r\n                     that bounds <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"4012616\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Plainpalais</tei-placeName> on the\r\n                     south.

The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and\r\n                     the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the\r\n                     events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress\r\n                     towards the creation; the appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my\r\n                     bed-side; its <tei-pb n=\"[1.149 - page breaks after 'depar-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/149.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed\r\n                     since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?\r\n                     Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in\r\n                     carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night,\r\n                     which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the\r\n                     inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and\r\n                     despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with\r\n                     the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had\r\n                     now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from\r\n                     the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Day dawned; and I directed my steps <tei-pb n=\"[1.150]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/150.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> towards the town. The gates were open; and\r\n                     I hastened to my father's house. My first thought was to discover what I knew\r\n                     of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I\r\n                     reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed,\r\n                     and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an\r\n                     inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had\r\n                     been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an\r\n                     air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if\r\n                     any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it\r\n                     as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would\r\n                     elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives\r\n                     to commence it. <tei-pb n=\"[1.151]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/151.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> Besides, of\r\n                     what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\r\n                     overhanging sides of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1106285\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mont\r\n                        Salêve</tei-placeName>? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to\r\n                     remain silent.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house. I told the\r\n                     servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their\r\n                     usual hour of rising.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\r\n                     stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure\r\n                     for <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7017035\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Ingolstadt</tei-placeName>.

It was an historical subject, painted\r\n                     at my father's desire, and represented <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Caroline Beaufort</tei-persName>\r\n                     in an <tei-pb n=\"[1.152 - page breaks after 'ago-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/152.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was\r\n                     rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that\r\n                     hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName>; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.\r\n                     While I was thus engaged, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName> entered: he had heard me\r\n                     arrive, and hastened to welcome me.

My father and the rest of the family being obliged to\r\n                     attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this\r\n                     wretched mockery of justice, I suffered living torture. It was to be decided,\r\n                     whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of\r\n                     two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of innocence and joy; the\r\n                     other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of <tei-pb n=\"[1.161 - page breaks after 'in-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/161.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> also was a girl of merit, and possessed\r\n                     qualities which promised to render her life happy: now all was to be\r\n                     obliterated in an ignominious grave; and I the cause! A thousand times rather\r\n                     would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName>; but I was absent when it was committed, and\r\n                     such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman, and\r\n                     would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The appearance of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> was calm. She was dressed in\r\n                     mourning; and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity\r\n                     of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\r\n                     innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands;\r\n                     for all the <tei-pb n=\"[1.162]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/162.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> kindness which her\r\n                     beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the\r\n                     spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have\r\n                     committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained;\r\n                     and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\r\n                     worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court, she\r\n                     threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear\r\n                     seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered herself, and a\r\n                     look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The trial began; and after the advocate against her had stated the charge,\r\n                     several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her,\r\n                     which might have staggered any one <tei-pb n=\"[1.163]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/163.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> who had not such proof of her innocence as\r\n                     I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been\r\n                     committed, and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far\r\n                     from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.\r\n                     The woman asked her what she did there; but she looked very strangely, and only\r\n                     returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about\r\n                     eight o'clock; and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\r\n                     replied, that she had been looking for the child, and demanded earnestly, if\r\n                     any thing had been heard concerning him. When shewn the body, she fell into\r\n                     violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then\r\n                     produced, which the servant had found in her pocket; and when\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, in <tei-pb n=\"[1.164]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/164.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> a faltering voice, proved that it was the\r\n                     same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his\r\n                     neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> was called on for her defence. As the trial had\r\n                     proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery, were\r\n                     strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears; but when she was\r\n                     desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke in an audible although\r\n                     variable voice:—</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#moritz\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"God knows,\"</tei-said> she said, <tei-said who=\"#moritz\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"how\r\n                        entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations should\r\n                        acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the\r\n                        facts which have been adduced against me; and I hope the character I have\r\n                        always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation, where\r\n                           <tei-pb n=\"[1.165]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/165.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> any circumstance appears\r\n                        doubtful or suspicious.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">She then related that, by the permission of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, she\r\n                     had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed, at\r\n                     the house of an aunt at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"8700245\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Chêne</tei-placeName>,\r\n                     a village situated at about a league from <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>. On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man,\r\n                     who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was\r\n                     alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the\r\n                     gates of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> were shut, and\r\n                     she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a\r\n                     cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well\r\n                     known. Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted her asylum early, that she might\r\n                     again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot <tei-pb n=\"[1.166]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/166.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> where his body lay, it was\r\n                     without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned by the\r\n                     market-woman, was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night, and\r\n                     the fate of poor <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName> was yet uncertain. Concerning the\r\n                     picture she could give no account.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#moritz\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I know,\"</tei-said> continued the unhappy victim, <tei-said who=\"#moritz\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against\r\n                        me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter\r\n                        ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by\r\n                        which it might have been placed in my pocket.

It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward\r\n                        on this occasion; but when I see a fellow-creature about to perish through\r\n                        the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that\r\n                        I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the\r\n                        accused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five, and\r\n                        at another for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me\r\n                        the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Frankenstein</tei-persName>, my aunt, in her last illness with the\r\n                        greatest affection and care; and <tei-pb n=\"[1.169]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/169.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> afterwards attended her own mother\r\n                        during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who\r\n                        knew her. After which she again lived in my uncle's house, where she was\r\n                        beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now\r\n                        dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own\r\n                        part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the evidence\r\n                        produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had\r\n                        no temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof\r\n                        rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to\r\n                        her; so much do I esteem and value her.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Excellent <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>!

She herself wept\r\n                     as <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> spoke, but she did not answer. My own\r\n                     agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her\r\n                     innocence; I knew it.

The\r\n                     tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but\r\n                     the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I passed a night of unmingled <tei-pb n=\"[1.171 - page breaks after 'wretch-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol1/171.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> wretchedness.

The blood\r\n                     flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\r\n                     heart, which <tei-pb n=\"[2.2]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/2.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> nothing could remove.\r\n                     Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed\r\n                     deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more, (I\r\n                     persuaded myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and\r\n                     the love of virtue.

Now all was blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience,\r\n                     which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from\r\n                     thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of\r\n                     guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures, such as no language\r\n                     can describe.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely recovered <tei-pb n=\"[2.3]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/3.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> from the first shock it had\r\n                     sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was\r\n                     torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, death-like\r\n                     solitude.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and\r\n                     habits, and endeavoured to reason with me on the folly of giving way to\r\n                     immoderate grief. <tei-said who=\"#father\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Do you think,\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Victor</tei-persName>,\"</tei-said> said he, <tei-said who=\"#father\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"that I\r\n                        do not suffer also?

This change was particularly agreeable to me. The\r\n                     shutting of the gates regularly at ten o'clock, and the impossibility of\r\n                     remaining on the lake after that hour, had rendered our residence within the\r\n                     walls of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> very irksome to\r\n                     me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the\r\n                     night, I took the boat, and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with\r\n                     my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the\r\n                     middle of the lake, I <tei-pb n=\"[2.5]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/5.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> left the\r\n                     boat to pursue its own course, and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I\r\n                     was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet\r\n                     thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly, if I except\r\n                     some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only\r\n                     when I approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the\r\n                     silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever.\r\n                     But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence\r\n                     was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father, and surviving brother:\r\n                     should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice\r\n                     of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">At these moments I wept bitterly, <tei-pb n=\"[2.6]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/6.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them\r\n                     consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every\r\n                     hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils; and I lived in daily fear,\r\n                     lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I\r\n                     had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he would still commit\r\n                     some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection\r\n                     of the past. There was always scope for fear, so long as anything I loved\r\n                     remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I\r\n                     thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently\r\n                     wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\r\n                     reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and <tei-pb n=\"[2.7]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/7.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I\r\n                     would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1108861\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Andes</tei-placeName>, could I, when there, have precipitated him\r\n                     to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent\r\n                     of anger on his head, and avenge the deaths of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName> and\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName>.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Our house was the house of mourning. My father's health was deeply shaken by\r\n                     the horror of the recent events. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> was sad and\r\n                     desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\r\n                     pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\r\n                     then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and\r\n                     destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature, who in earlier youth wandered\r\n                     with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with ecstasy of our future\r\n                     prospects. She <tei-pb n=\"[2.8]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/8.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> had become grave,\r\n                     and often conversed of the inconstancy of fortune, and the instability of human\r\n                     life.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#elizabeth\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"When I reflect, my dear cousin,\"</tei-said> said she, <tei-said who=\"#elizabeth\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"on the miserable death of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine\r\n                           Moritz</tei-persName>, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\r\n                        appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice,\r\n                        that I read in books or heard from others, as tales of ancient days, or\r\n                        imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more familiar to reason than\r\n                        to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as\r\n                        monsters thirsting for each other's blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Every\r\n                        body believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed\r\n                        the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most\r\n                        depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, <tei-pb n=\"[2.9]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/9.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> to have murdered the son of her benefactor\r\n                        and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love\r\n                        as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human\r\n                        being; but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain\r\n                        in the society of men. Yet she was innocent. I know, I feel she was\r\n                        innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas!\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Victor</tei-persName>, when falsehood can look so like the truth,\r\n                        who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel if I were walking on\r\n                        the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding, and\r\n                        endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName> and\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName> were assassinated, and the murderer escapes;\r\n                        he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected.

It was\r\n                     from this cause that he had removed to the country; and, induced by the same\r\n                     motive, he now proposed that we should all make an excursion to the valley of\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1032562\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Chamounix</tei-placeName>. I had been there\r\n                     before, but <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName>\r\n                     never had; and both had often expressed an earnest desire to see the scenery of\r\n                     this place, which had been described to them as so wonderful and sublime.\r\n                     Accordingly we departed from <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> on this tour about the middle of the month of August,\r\n                     nearly two months after the death of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName>.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[2.12]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/12.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The weather was uncommonly fine; and if mine had been a sorrow to be chased\r\n                     away by any fleeting circumstance, this excursion would certainly have had the\r\n                     effect intended by my father. As it was, I was somewhat interested in the\r\n                     scene; it sometimes lulled, although it could not extinguish my grief. During\r\n                     the first day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had seen the\r\n                     mountains at a distance, towards which we gradually advanced. We perceived that\r\n                     the valley through which we wound, and which was formed by the river <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1121418\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Arve</tei-placeName>, whose course we followed, closed\r\n                     in upon us by degrees; and when the sun had set, we beheld immense mountains\r\n                     and precipices overhanging us on every side, and heard the sound of the river\r\n                     raging among rocks, and the dashing of waterfalls around.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[2.13]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/13.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The next day we pursued our journey upon mules; and as we ascended still\r\n                     higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined\r\n                     castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1121418\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Arve</tei-placeName>, and cottages every here and there\r\n                     peeping forth from among the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it\r\n                     was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7007746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Alps</tei-placeName>, whose white and shining pyramids and domes\r\n                     towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another\r\n                     race of beings.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We passed the bridge of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Pelissier</tei-placeName>, where the ravine,\r\n                     which the river forms, opened before us, and we began to ascend the mountain\r\n                     that overhangs it. Soon after we entered the valley of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1032562\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Chamounix</tei-placeName>. This valley is more wonderful and\r\n                     sublime, but not so beautiful <tei-pb n=\"[2.13]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/13.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     and picturesque as that of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1035711\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Servox</tei-placeName>, through which we had just passed. The high and snowy\r\n                     mountains were its immediate boundaries; but we saw no more ruined castles and\r\n                     fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; we heard the rumbling\r\n                     thunder of the falling avelânche, and marked the smoke of its passage.\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7617157\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mont Blanc</tei-placeName>, the supreme and\r\n                     magnificent <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7617157\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mont Blanc</tei-placeName>, raised\r\n                     itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(dome)</tei-hi> overlooked the valley.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">During this journey, I sometimes joined <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, and\r\n                     exerted myself to point out to her the various beauties of the scene. I often\r\n                     suffered my mule to lag behind, and indulged in the misery of reflection. At\r\n                     other times I spurred on the animal before my companions, that I might forget\r\n                     them, the world, and, more than all, myself. When at <tei-pb n=\"[2.15]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/15.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> a distance, I alighted, and threw myself on\r\n                     the grass, weighed down by horror and despair. At eight in the evening I\r\n                     arrived at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1032562\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Chamounix</tei-placeName>. My father\r\n                     and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> were very much fatigued;\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName>, who accompanied us, was delighted, and in high\r\n                     spirits: the only circumstance that detracted from his pleasure was the south\r\n                     wind, and the rain it seemed to promise for the next day.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did not. I\r\n                     remained many hours at the window, watching the pallid lightning that played\r\n                     above <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7617157\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mont Blanc</tei-placeName>, and listening\r\n                     to the rushing of the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1121418\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Arve</tei-placeName>,\r\n                     which ran below my window.</tei-p></tei-said>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </tei-div>\r\n\r\n\r\n            <tei-div n=\"2.2\" type=\"chapter\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"type n\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[2.16]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/16.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-head data-origname=\"head\">Chapter II</tei-head>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\"><tei-p data-origname=\"p\">THE next day, contrary to the prognostications of our guides,\r\n                     was fine, although clouded. We visited the source of the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7622466\" cert=\"medium\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"cert key type\">Arveiron</tei-placeName><!-- see 1781 watercolor by Francis Towne http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/towne-the-source-of-the-arveyron-t08147 -->,\r\n                     and rode about the valley until evening. These sublime and magnificent scenes\r\n                     afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They\r\n                     elevated me from all littleness of feeling; and although they did not remove my\r\n                     grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some degree, also, they diverted\r\n                     my mind from the thoughts over which it had <tei-pb n=\"[2.17]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/17.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> brooded for the last month. I returned in\r\n                     the evening, fatigued, but less unhappy, and conversed with my family with more\r\n                     cheerfulness than had been my custom for some time. My father was pleased, and\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> overjoyed. <tei-said who=\"#elizabeth\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"My dear\r\n                        cousin,\"</tei-said> said she, <tei-said who=\"#elizabeth\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"you see what happiness you\r\n                        diffuse when you are happy; do not relapse again!\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The following morning the rain poured down in torrents, and thick mists hid the\r\n                     summits of the mountains. I rose early, but felt unusually melancholy. The rain\r\n                     depressed me; my old feelings recurred, and I was miserable. I knew how\r\n                     disappointed my father would be at this sudden change, and I wished to avoid\r\n                     him until I had recovered myself so far as to be enabled to conceal those\r\n                     feelings that overpowered me. I knew that they would remain that day at the\r\n                     inn; <tei-pb n=\"[2.18]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/18.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> and as I had ever inured\r\n                     myself to rain, moisture, and cold, I resolved to go alone to the summit of\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7622466\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Montanvert</tei-placeName>. I remembered the\r\n                     effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced\r\n                     upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy\r\n                     that gave wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to\r\n                     light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always\r\n                     the effect of solemnizing my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares\r\n                     of life. I determined to go alone, for I was well acquainted with the path, and\r\n                     the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\r\n                     windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the <tei-pb n=\"[2.19]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/19.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> mountain. It is a scene\r\n                     terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avelânche\r\n                     may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground; some\r\n                     entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the\r\n                     mountain, or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is\r\n                     intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above;\r\n                     one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even\r\n                     speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\r\n                     destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant,\r\n                     but they are sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the\r\n                     valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it,\r\n                     and curling in thick wreaths around the <tei-pb n=\"[2.20 - page breaks after 'oppo-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/20.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\r\n                     poured from the dark sky, and added to the melancholy impression I received\r\n                     from the objects around me. Alas! why does man boast of sensibilities superior\r\n                     to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings. If\r\n                     our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly\r\n                     free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows, and a chance word or scene\r\n                     that that word may convey to us.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\"><tei-lb data-origname=\"lb\" data-empty=\"\"/>We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep. <tei-lb data-origname=\"lb\" data-empty=\"\"/>We rise; one\r\n                     wand'ring thought pollutes the day. <tei-lb data-origname=\"lb\" data-empty=\"\"/>We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh,\r\n                     or weep, <tei-lb data-origname=\"lb\" data-empty=\"\"/>Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; <tei-lb data-origname=\"lb\" data-empty=\"\"/>It is the same:\r\n                     for, be it joy or sorrow, <tei-lb data-origname=\"lb\" data-empty=\"\"/>The path of its departure still is free.\r\n                     <tei-lb data-origname=\"lb\" data-empty=\"\"/>Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow; <tei-lb data-origname=\"lb\" data-empty=\"\"/>Nought may endure but\r\n                     mutability!</tei-quote>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[2.21]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/21.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat\r\n                     upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the\r\n                     surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended\r\n                     upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a\r\n                     troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The\r\n                     field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in\r\n                     crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side\r\n                     where I now stood <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7622466\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Montanvert</tei-placeName>\r\n                     was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7617157\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mont Blanc</tei-placeName>, in awful majesty. I\r\n                     remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous\r\n                     scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent\r\n                     mountains, <tei-pb n=\"[2.22]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/22.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> whose aërial summits\r\n                     hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight\r\n                     over the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with\r\n                     something like joy; I exclaimed—<tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Wandering spirits, if\r\n                        indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint\r\n                        happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of\r\n                        life.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\r\n                     advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the\r\n                     ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature also, as he approached,\r\n                     seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I\r\n                     felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the\r\n                     mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer, (sight <tei-pb n=\"[2.23]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/23.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the\r\n                     wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait\r\n                     his approach, and then close with him in mortal combat.

I was partly\r\n                     urged by curiosity, and <tei-pb n=\"[2.31]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/31.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the\r\n                     murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this\r\n                     opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\r\n                     his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of\r\n                     his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed\r\n                     the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the\r\n                     rain again began to descend: we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of\r\n                     exultation, I with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits.

A\r\n                        strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and\r\n                        smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to\r\n                        distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I\r\n                        remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to\r\n                        shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but <tei-pb n=\"[2.33]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/33.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> hardly had I felt this, when,\r\n                        by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I\r\n                        walked, and, I believe, descended; but I presently found a great alteration\r\n                        in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me,\r\n                        impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at\r\n                        liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The\r\n                        light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I\r\n                        walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest\r\n                        near <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7017035\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Ingolstadt</tei-placeName>; and here I\r\n                        lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented\r\n                        by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate\r\n                        some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I\r\n                        slaked my <tei-pb n=\"[2.34]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/34.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> thirst at the\r\n                        brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened as it were\r\n                        instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your\r\n                        apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes;\r\n                        but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a\r\n                        poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing;\r\n                        but, feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens, and gave me a sensation of\r\n                        pleasure. I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.\r\n                        I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path;\r\n                        and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold, when under <tei-pb n=\"[2.35]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/35.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> one of the trees I found a\r\n                        huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No\r\n                        distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,\r\n                        and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and on all\r\n                        sides various scents saluted me: the only object that I could distinguish\r\n                        was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly\r\n                        lessened when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I\r\n                        gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink, and the\r\n                        trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first\r\n                        discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded\r\n                        from the throats of the little winged animals who <tei-pb n=\"[2.36]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/36.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> had often intercepted the light from my\r\n                        eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that\r\n                        surrounded me, and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light\r\n                        which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the\r\n                        birds, but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own\r\n                        mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened\r\n                        me into silence again.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form,\r\n                        shewed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had, by\r\n                        this time, become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas.\r\n                        My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to perceive objects in their\r\n                        right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and, by <tei-pb n=\"[2.37 - page breaks after 'de-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/37.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        degrees, one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but\r\n                        harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and\r\n                        enticing.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by\r\n                        some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I\r\n                        experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but\r\n                        quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that\r\n                        the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the\r\n                        materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I\r\n                        quickly collected some branches; but they were wet, and would not burn. I\r\n                        was pained at this, and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The\r\n                        wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried, and itself <tei-pb n=\"[2.38]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/38.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> became inflamed. I reflected on this;\r\n                        and, by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause, and busied\r\n                        myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it, and have\r\n                        a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on, and brought sleep with it, I\r\n                        was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it\r\n                        carefully with dry wood and leaves, and placed wet branches upon it; and\r\n                        then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground, and sunk into sleep.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I\r\n                        uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed\r\n                        this also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when\r\n                        they were nearly extinguished. When night came again, I found, with\r\n                        pleasure, that the fire gave light as <tei-pb n=\"[2.39]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/39.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> well as heat; and that the discovery of\r\n                        this element was useful to me in my food; for I found some of the offals\r\n                        that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury\r\n                        than the berries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my\r\n                        food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that the\r\n                        berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much\r\n                        improved.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching in\r\n                        vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I\r\n                        resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one\r\n                        where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this\r\n                        emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained\r\n                        through accident, and knew not how to <tei-pb n=\"[2.40]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/40.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> re-produce it. I gave several hours to\r\n                        the serious consideration of this difficulty; but I was obliged to\r\n                        relinquish all attempt to supply it; and, wrapping myself up in my cloak, I\r\n                        struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these\r\n                        rambles, and at length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had\r\n                        taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\r\n                        appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp\r\n                        substance that covered the ground.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter;\r\n                        at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless\r\n                        been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me;\r\n                        and I examined the structure with great <tei-pb n=\"[2.41 - page breaks after 'cu-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/41.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a\r\n                        fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a\r\n                        noise; and, perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and, quitting the hut, ran\r\n                        across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared\r\n                        capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his\r\n                        flight, somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the\r\n                        hut: here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it\r\n                        presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium\r\n                        appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I\r\n                        greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted\r\n                        of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. <tei-pb n=\"[2.42]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/42.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> Then overcome by fatigue, I\r\n                        lay down among some straw, and fell asleep.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone\r\n                        brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and,\r\n                        depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a wallet I found, I\r\n                        proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at\r\n                        a village. How miraculous did this appear! the huts, the neater cottages,\r\n                        and stately houses, engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the\r\n                        gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the\r\n                        cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered; but I had\r\n                        hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children shrieked, and one\r\n                        of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some <tei-pb n=\"[2.43 - page breaks after 'at-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/43.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of\r\n                        missile weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in\r\n                        a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces\r\n                        I had beheld in the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat\r\n                        and pleasant appearance; but, after my late dearly-bought experience, I\r\n                        dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low,\r\n                        that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed\r\n                        on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind\r\n                        entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the\r\n                        snow and rain.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Here then I retreated, and lay down, happy to have found a shelter, however\r\n                        miserable, from the inclemency <tei-pb n=\"[2.44]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/44.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel, that I might view the\r\n                        adjacent cottage, and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had\r\n                        found. It was situated against the back of the cottage, and surrounded on\r\n                        the sides which were exposed by a pig-stye and a clear pool of water. One\r\n                        part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice\r\n                        by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner\r\n                        that I might move them on occasion to pass out: all the light I enjoyed came\r\n                        through the stye, and that was sufficient for me.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Having thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean straw, I\r\n                        retired; for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too\r\n                           <tei-pb n=\"[2.45]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/45.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> well my treatment the\r\n                        night before, to trust myself in his power. I had first, however, provided\r\n                        for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf of coarse bread, which I\r\n                        purloined, and a cup with which I could drink, more conveniently than from\r\n                        my hand, of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a\r\n                        little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the\r\n                        chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until something\r\n                        should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise,\r\n                        compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping\r\n                        branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure, and was about to\r\n                        remove a plank to procure myself a little water, when I heard a step, and,\r\n                        looking <tei-pb n=\"[2.46]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/46.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> through a small\r\n                        chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my\r\n                        hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since\r\n                        found cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\r\n                        coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair\r\n                        was plaited, but not adorned; she looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight of\r\n                        her; and in about a quarter of an hour she returned, bearing the pail, which\r\n                        was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded\r\n                        by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper\r\n                        despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the\r\n                        pail from her head, and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and\r\n                        they disappeared. Presently I saw the young <tei-pb n=\"[2.47]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/47.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> man again, with some tools in his hand,\r\n                        cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes\r\n                        in the house, and sometimes in the yard.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had\r\n                        formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood.\r\n                        In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink, through which\r\n                        the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice, a small room was\r\n                        visible, white-washed and clean, but very bare of furniture. In one corner,\r\n                        near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a\r\n                        disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage;\r\n                        but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands,\r\n                        and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began <tei-pb n=\"[2.48]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/48.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> to play, and to produce\r\n                        sounds, sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a\r\n                        lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld aught beautiful\r\n                        before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager, won\r\n                        my reverence; while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He\r\n                        played a sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of\r\n                        his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed\r\n                        audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her\r\n                        work, knelt at his feet. He raised her, and smiled with such kindness and\r\n                        affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and over-powering nature:\r\n                        they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before\r\n                        experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I <tei-pb n=\"[2.49]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/49.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> withdrew from the window,\r\n                        unable to bear these emotions.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of\r\n                        wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden,\r\n                        and, taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then\r\n                        she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he shewed her a\r\n                        large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased, and went into the\r\n                        garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon\r\n                        the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into\r\n                        the garden, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.\r\n                        After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him,\r\n                        and they entered the cottage together.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The old man had, in the mean time, <tei-pb n=\"[2.50]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/50.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> been pensive; but, on the appearance of\r\n                        his companions, he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.\r\n                        The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied in\r\n                        arranging the cottage; the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for\r\n                        a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in\r\n                        beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was old, with\r\n                        silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love: the\r\n                        younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded\r\n                        with the finest symmetry; yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost\r\n                        sadness and despondency. The old man returned to the cottage; and the youth,\r\n                        with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his\r\n                        steps across the fields.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.51]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/51.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers\r\n                        had a means of prolonging light, by the use of tapers, and was delighted to\r\n                        find, that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I\r\n                        experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening, the young girl\r\n                        and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not\r\n                        understand; and the old man again took up the instrument, which produced the\r\n                        divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had\r\n                        finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were\r\n                        monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument\r\n                        or the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that\r\n                        time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.52]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/52.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished\r\n                        their lights, and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.</tei-p>\r\n                  </tei-said></tei-said>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </tei-div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <tei-div n=\"2.4\" type=\"chapter\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"type n\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[2.53]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/53.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-head data-origname=\"head\">Chapter IV</tei-head>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\"><tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\"><tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I LAY on my straw, but I could not\r\n                        sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was\r\n                        the gentle manners of these people; and I longed to join them, but dared\r\n                        not. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before\r\n                        from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\r\n                        might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\r\n                        remain quietly in my hovel, watching, and endeavouring to discover the\r\n                        motives which influenced their actions.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.54]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/54.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman\r\n                        arranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed after\r\n                        the first meal.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young\r\n                        man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious\r\n                        occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed\r\n                        his leisure hours on his instrument, or in contemplation. Nothing could\r\n                        exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards\r\n                        their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of\r\n                        affection and duty with gentleness; and he rewarded them by his benevolent\r\n                        smiles.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often <tei-pb n=\"[2.55]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/55.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> went apart, and appeared to\r\n                        weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness; but I was deeply affected by it.\r\n                        If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an\r\n                        imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle\r\n                        beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my\r\n                        eyes), and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill, and\r\n                        delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and,\r\n                        still more, they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging\r\n                        each day looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did\r\n                        they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions;\r\n                        but perpetual attention, and time, explained to me many appearances which\r\n                        were at first enigmatic.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.56]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/56.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the\r\n                        uneasiness of this amiable family; it was poverty; and they suffered that\r\n                        evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of\r\n                        the vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow, who gave very\r\n                        little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to\r\n                        support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very\r\n                        poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers; for several times they\r\n                        placed food before the old man, when they reserved none for themselves.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the\r\n                        night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption; but when I\r\n                        found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, <tei-pb n=\"[2.57]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/57.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> and satisfied myself with\r\n                        berries, nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their\r\n                        labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting\r\n                        wood for the family fire; and, during the night, I often took his tools, the\r\n                        use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for\r\n                        the consumption of several days.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened\r\n                        the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile\r\n                        of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\r\n                        youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\r\n                        that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in <tei-pb n=\"[2.58 - page breaks after 'repair-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/58.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        repairing the cottage, and cultivating the garden.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these\r\n                        people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to\r\n                        one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke\r\n                        sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and\r\n                        countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I\r\n                        ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every\r\n                        attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the\r\n                        words they uttered, not having any apparent connexion with visible objects,\r\n                        I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of\r\n                        their reference. By great application, however, and after having <tei-pb n=\"[2.59 - page breaks after 're-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/59.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\r\n                        discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\r\n                        discourse; I learned and applied the words <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(fire)</tei-hi>,\r\n                           <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(milk)</tei-hi>, <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(bread)</tei-hi>, and <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(wood)</tei-hi>. I learned also the names of the cottagers\r\n                        themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but\r\n                        the old man had only one, which was <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(father)</tei-hi>. The\r\n                        girl was called <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(sister)</tei-hi>, or <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\"><tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(Agatha)</tei-hi></tei-persName>; and the youth <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\"><tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(Felix)</tei-hi>\r\n                        </tei-persName>, <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(brother)</tei-hi>, or <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(son)</tei-hi>. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the\r\n                        ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them.\r\n                        I distinguished several other words, without being able as yet to understand\r\n                        or apply them; such as <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(good)</tei-hi>, <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(dearest)</tei-hi>, <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(unhappy)</tei-hi>.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the <tei-pb n=\"[2.60]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/60.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> cottagers greatly endeared\r\n                        them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I\r\n                        sympathized in their joys. I saw few human beings beside them; and if any\r\n                        other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only\r\n                        enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I\r\n                        could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I\r\n                        found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\r\n                        cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even\r\n                        upon me. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName> listened with respect, her eyes\r\n                        sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived;\r\n                        but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\r\n                        having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName>. He <tei-pb n=\"[2.61]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/61.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> was always the saddest of the groupe;\r\n                        and, even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply\r\n                        than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was\r\n                        more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\r\n                        man.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked the\r\n                        dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want,\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> carried with pleasure to his sister the first\r\n                        little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in\r\n                        the morning before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed\r\n                        her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood\r\n                        from the out-house, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store\r\n                        always <tei-pb n=\"[2.62 - page breaks after 'reple-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/62.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> replenished by an invisible hand. In the\r\n                        day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he\r\n                        often went forth, and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with\r\n                        him. At other times he worked in the garden; but, as there was little to do\r\n                        in the frosty season, he read to the old man and\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName>.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I\r\n                        discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he\r\n                        talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for\r\n                        speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also;\r\n                        but how was that possible, when I did not even understand the sounds for\r\n                        which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science,\r\n                        but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of <tei-pb n=\"[2.63]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/63.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> conversation, although I applied my whole\r\n                        mind to the endeavour: for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly\r\n                        longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt\r\n                        until I had first become master of their language; which knowledge might\r\n                        enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with this\r\n                        also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me\r\n                        acquainted.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and\r\n                        delicate complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a\r\n                        transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was\r\n                        indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced\r\n                        that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest\r\n                           <tei-pb n=\"[2.64 - page breaks after 'sen-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/64.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely\r\n                        know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished,\r\n                        and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> was more employed; and the heart-moving\r\n                        indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards\r\n                        found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of\r\n                        it. Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed;\r\n                        and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not\r\n                        rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. <tei-pb n=\"[2.65]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/65.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> This frequently took place;\r\n                        but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more\r\n                        pleasant than it had been.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the\r\n                        motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various\r\n                        occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my\r\n                        friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night\r\n                        was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food and fuel\r\n                        for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared\r\n                        their path of the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName>. I afterwards found that these labours,\r\n                        performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I\r\n                        heard them, on these <tei-pb n=\"[2.66]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/66.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        occasions, utter the words <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(good spirit)</tei-hi>, <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\">(wonderful)</tei-hi>; but I did not then understand the\r\n                        signification of these terms.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and\r\n                        feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> appeared so miserable, and\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName> so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it\r\n                        might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I\r\n                        slept, or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName>, and the excellent\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName>, flitted before me. I looked upon them as\r\n                        superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in\r\n                        my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their\r\n                        reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my\r\n                        gentle demeanour and conciliating <tei-pb n=\"[2.67]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/67.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> words, I should first win their favour,\r\n                        and afterwards their love.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the\r\n                        acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple: and\r\n                        although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I\r\n                        pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass\r\n                        and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were\r\n                        affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than\r\n                        blows and execration.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect\r\n                        of the earth. Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves,\r\n                        dispersed themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The\r\n                        birds sang in more <tei-pb n=\"[2.68 - page breaks after 'cheer-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/68.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> cheerful notes, and the leaves began to\r\n                        bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which,\r\n                        so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were\r\n                        elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from\r\n                        my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of\r\n                        hope, and anticipations of joy.</tei-p></tei-said></tei-said>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </tei-div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <tei-div n=\"2.5\" type=\"chapter\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"type n\">\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[2.69]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/69.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-head data-origname=\"head\">Chapter V</tei-head>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\r\n                  <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I NOW hasten to the more moving part of my story.

My senses were gratified and\r\n                        refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a thousand sights of\r\n                        beauty.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.70]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/70.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from\r\n                        labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—I\r\n                        observed that the countenance of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> was melancholy\r\n                        beyond expression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his\r\n                        music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his\r\n                        son's sorrow. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> replied in a cheerful accent, and\r\n                        the old man was recommencing his music when some one tapped at the door.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady\r\n                        was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil.\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName> asked a question; to which the stranger only\r\n                        replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName>. Her voice was musical, but unlike that of <tei-pb n=\"[2.71]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/71.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> either of my friends. On\r\n                        hearing this word, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> came up hastily to the lady;\r\n                        who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of\r\n                        angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and\r\n                        curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her\r\n                        features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each\r\n                        cheek tinged with a lovely pink.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> seemed ravished with delight when he saw her,\r\n                        every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a\r\n                        degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable;\r\n                        his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\r\n                        thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different\r\n                        feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, <tei-pb n=\"[2.72]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/72.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> she held out her hand to\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName>, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as\r\n                        well as I could distinguish, his sweet <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Arabian</tei-persName>. She did\r\n                        not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and,\r\n                        dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took\r\n                        place between him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old\r\n                        man's feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and embraced\r\n                        her affectionately.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and\r\n                        appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, or\r\n                        herself understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not\r\n                        comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the\r\n                        cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> seemed <tei-pb n=\"[2.73]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/73.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> peculiarly happy, and with smiles of\r\n                        delight welcomed his <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Arabian</tei-persName>.\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName>, the ever-gentle <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName>,\r\n                        kissed the hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made\r\n                        signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\r\n                        came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed\r\n                        joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the\r\n                        frequent recurrence of one sound which the stranger repeated after them,\r\n                        that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly\r\n                        occurred to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the same\r\n                        end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of\r\n                        them indeed were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the\r\n                        others.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As night came on, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName> and the <tei-pb n=\"[2.74]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/74.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Arabian</tei-persName> retired early. When they separated,\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> kissed the hand of the stranger, and said,\r\n                        Good night, sweet <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName>. He sat up much longer,\r\n                        conversing with his father; and, by the frequent repetition of her name, I\r\n                        conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I\r\n                        ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that\r\n                        purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The next morning <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> went out to his work; and, after\r\n                        the usual occupations of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName> were finished, the\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Arabian</tei-persName> sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking\r\n                        his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once\r\n                        drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice\r\n                        flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the\r\n                        woods.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.75]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/75.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When she had finished, she gave the guitar to <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName>,\r\n                        who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied\r\n                        it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old\r\n                        man appeared enraptured, and said some words, which\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName> endeavoured to explain to\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName>, and by which he appeared to wish to express\r\n                        that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The days now passed as peacefully as before, with the sole alteration that\r\n                        joy had taken the place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName> was always gay and happy; she and I improved\r\n                        rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to\r\n                        comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and <tei-pb n=\"[2.76]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/76.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the green banks interspersed\r\n                        with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale\r\n                        radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear\r\n                        and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although\r\n                        they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the\r\n                        sun; for I never ventured abroad during day-light, fearful of meeting with\r\n                        the same treatment as I had formerly endured in the first village which I\r\n                        entered.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the\r\n                        language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Arabian</tei-persName>, who understood very little, and conversed\r\n                        in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word\r\n                        that was spoken.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">While I improved in speech, I also <tei-pb n=\"[2.77]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/77.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> learned the science of letters, as it was\r\n                        taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for wonder\r\n                        and delight.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The book from which <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> instructed\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName> was <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Volney's Ruins of\r\n                              Empires</tei-title></tei-hi> . I should not have understood the purport of\r\n                        this book, had not <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName>, in reading it, given very\r\n                        minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the\r\n                        declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors. Through\r\n                        this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the\r\n                        several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into\r\n                        the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the\r\n                        earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius and mental\r\n                        activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early\r\n                        Romans— <tei-pb n=\"[2.78]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/78.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> of their subsequent\r\n                        degeneration—of the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry,\r\n                        Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"8698314\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">American hemisphere</tei-placeName>, and wept with\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName> over the hapless fate of its original\r\n                        inhabitants.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man,\r\n                        indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious\r\n                        and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at\r\n                        another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and\r\n                        virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being;\r\n                        to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest\r\n                        degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless\r\n                        worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go <tei-pb n=\"[2.79]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/79.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> forth to murder his fellow, or\r\n                        even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice\r\n                        and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and\r\n                        loathing.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I\r\n                        listened to the instructions which <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> bestowed upon\r\n                        the <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Arabian</tei-persName>, the strange system of human society was\r\n                        explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and\r\n                        squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions\r\n                        most esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and unsullied descent\r\n                        united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these\r\n                        acquisitions; but without either he was considered, except in very rare\r\n                        instances, <tei-pb n=\"[2.80]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/80.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> as a vagabond and\r\n                        a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profit of the chosen few. And\r\n                        what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew\r\n                        that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\r\n                        endowed with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of\r\n                        the same nature as man. I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon\r\n                        coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my\r\n                        frame; my stature far exceeded their's. When I looked around, I saw and\r\n                        heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth, from\r\n                        which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me;\r\n                        I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that\r\n                           <tei-pb n=\"[2.81]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/81.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> I had forever remained in\r\n                        my native wood, nor known or felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst,\r\n                        and heat!</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has\r\n                        once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake\r\n                        off all thought and feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to\r\n                        overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared\r\n                        yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings, and loved the\r\n                        gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I was shut out\r\n                        from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by\r\n                        stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than\r\n                        satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle\r\n                        words of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName>, <tei-pb n=\"[2.82]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/82.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> and the animated smiles of the charming\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Arabian</tei-persName>, were not for me. The mild exhortations of\r\n                        the old man, and the lively conversation of the loved\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName>, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy\r\n                        wretch!</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the\r\n                        difference of sexes; of the birth and growth of children; how the father\r\n                        doated on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older\r\n                        child; how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the\r\n                        precious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge; of\r\n                        brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human\r\n                        being to another in mutual bonds.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant\r\n                        days, no mother had blessed me <tei-pb n=\"[2.83]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/83.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a\r\n                        blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest\r\n                        remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never\r\n                        yet seen a being resembling me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What\r\n                        was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to\r\n                        return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of\r\n                        indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional\r\n                        love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half\r\n                        painful self-deceit, to call them).</tei-p>\r\n                  </tei-said></tei-said>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </tei-div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <tei-div n=\"2.6\" type=\"chapter\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"type n\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[2.84]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/84.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-head data-origname=\"head\">Chapter VI</tei-head>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\r\n                  <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">SOME time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one\r\n                        which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it\r\n                        did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so\r\n                        utterly inexperienced as I was.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The name of the old man was <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">De Lacey</tei-persName>. He was descended\r\n                        from a good family in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000070\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">France</tei-placeName>, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\r\n                        respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in\r\n                        the <tei-pb n=\"[2.85 - page breaks after 'ser-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/85.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> service of his country; and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName> had ranked with\r\n                        ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had\r\n                        lived in a large and luxurious city, called <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7008038\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Paris</tei-placeName>, surrounded by friends, and possessed of\r\n                        every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied\r\n                        by a moderate fortune, could afford.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The father of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName> had been the cause of their ruin.\r\n                        He was a <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">Turkish</tei-foreign> merchant, and had inhabited <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7008038\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Paris</tei-placeName> for many years, when, for some\r\n                        reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He\r\n                        was seized and cast into prison the very day that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName>\r\n                        arrived from <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002473\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Constantinople</tei-placeName>\r\n                        to join him. He was tried, and condemned to death. The injustice of his\r\n                        sentence was very flagrant; all <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7008038\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Paris</tei-placeName> was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and\r\n                        wealth, rather than the <tei-pb n=\"[2.86]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/86.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> crime\r\n                        alleged against him, had been the cause of his condemnation.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> had been present at the trial; his horror and\r\n                        indignation were uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court. He\r\n                        made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around\r\n                        for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the\r\n                        prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the\r\n                        building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan; who,\r\n                        loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous\r\n                        sentence. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> visited the grate at night, and made\r\n                        known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.

The story follows\r\n                           the life of <tei-ref target=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Sorrows-of-Young-Werther\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">Werther</tei-ref>, a young artist, who is writing to his friend Wilhelm.\r\n                           Werther falls in love with Charlotte, a woman already promised to his\r\n                           friend, Albert. Despite the agony caused by this love triangle, Werther\r\n                           cultivates a friendship with the couple, until the pain and sorrow of his\r\n                           love overpowers him and he leaves. When Werther returns, he finds the\r\n                           couple now married. He lessens his visits to Charlotte, out of respect\r\n                           for her husband, but ultimately realizes that in order to resolve the\r\n                           love triangle, he must die. He commits suicide, and the novel ends with\r\n                           Charlotte potentially dying of a broken heart. The novel was an amazing\r\n                           hit, creating a wave not only in literary circles but also across fashion\r\n                           and society.

In the same vein, Shelley is critiquing the\r\n                           idea that love can be engineered to solve problems. Instead, she argues\r\n                           the romantic idea of organically developing love, like that between Safi\r\n                           and Felix, is desirable, unlike the engineered or arranged romances of\r\n                           Frankenstein and Elizabeth (or the Creature’s partner to-be).

They produced in me\r\n                        an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy,\r\n                        but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Sorrows of Werter</tei-title></tei-hi>, besides the interest\r\n                        of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed, and so\r\n                        many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects, that\r\n                        I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The\r\n                        gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\r\n                        feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well\r\n                        with my experience among my protectors, and with the wants which were for\r\n                        ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Werter</tei-persName>\r\n                        himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or <tei-pb n=\"[2.101]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/101.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> imagined; his character contained no\r\n                        pretension, but it sunk deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were\r\n                        calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the\r\n                        merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose\r\n                        extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\r\n                        condition. I found myself similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike the\r\n                        beings concerning whom I read, and to whose conversation I was a listener. I\r\n                        sympathized with, and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I\r\n                        was dependent on none and related to none. The path of my departure was\r\n                        free; and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous\r\n                        and <tei-pb n=\"[2.102]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/102.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> my stature gigantic:\r\n                        what did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\r\n                        destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve\r\n                        them.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The volume of <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Plutarch's Lives</tei-title></tei-hi>, which\r\n                        I possessed, contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient\r\n                        republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Sorrows of Werter</tei-title></tei-hi>.

Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a\r\n                        very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\r\n                        and boundless seas. But I was <tei-pb n=\"[2.103]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/103.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> perfectly unacquainted with towns, and large assemblages of men. The\r\n                        cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied\r\n                        human nature; but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I\r\n                        read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their\r\n                        species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and\r\n                        abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those\r\n                        terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.\r\n                        Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable law\r\n                        givers, <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n85202845\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Numa</tei-persName>, <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n79110932\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Solon</tei-persName>, and <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"nr96035470\" cert=\"medium\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"cert key type\">Lycurgus</tei-persName>, in preference to\r\n                           <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n83206699\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Romulus</tei-persName> and <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"no2014083772\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Theseus</tei-persName>. The patriarchal lives\r\n                        of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind;\r\n                        perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young\r\n                        soldier, burning for glory and <tei-pb n=\"[2.104]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/104.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> slaughter, I should have been imbued\r\n                        with different sensations.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But <tei-hi rend=\"italic\" data-origname=\"hi\" data-origatts=\"rend\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Paradise Lost</tei-title></tei-hi> excited different\r\n                        and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which\r\n                        had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of\r\n                        wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">God</tei-persName>\r\n                        warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the\r\n                        several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Adam</tei-persName>, I was created apparently united by no link to\r\n                        any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in\r\n                        every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">God</tei-persName> a perfect creature, happy and prosperous,\r\n                        guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse\r\n                        with, and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature: but I was\r\n                        wretched, <tei-pb n=\"[2.105]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/105.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> helpless, and\r\n                        alone. Many times I considered <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Satan</tei-persName> as the fitter\r\n                        emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my\r\n                        protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after\r\n                        my arrival in the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress\r\n                        which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them; but\r\n                        now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I\r\n                        began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months\r\n                        that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step\r\n                        you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with\r\n                        accounts of domestic occurrences. You, doubtless, recollect these papers.\r\n                        Here they are. Every <tei-pb n=\"[2.106]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/106.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> thing\r\n                        is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole\r\n                        detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set\r\n                        in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is\r\n                        given, in language which painted your own horrors, and rendered mine\r\n                        ineffaceable. I sickened as I read.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Hateful day when I received life! I exclaimed in agony. Cursed creator! Why\r\n                        did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust?\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">God</tei-persName> in pity made man beautiful and alluring, after\r\n                        his own image; but my form is a filthy type of your’s, more horrid from its\r\n                        very resemblance. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Satan</tei-persName> had his companions,\r\n                        fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and\r\n                        detested.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; <tei-pb n=\"[2.107]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/107.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> but when I contemplated the\r\n                        virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I\r\n                        persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration\r\n                        of their virtues, they would compassionate me, and overlook my personal\r\n                        deformity. Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who\r\n                        solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to\r\n                        despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which\r\n                        would decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer; for\r\n                        the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I\r\n                        should fail. Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with\r\n                        every day's experience, that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\r\n                        until a few more months should have added to my wisdom.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.108]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/108.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The presence of\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName> diffused happiness among its inhabitants; and\r\n                        I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName> spent more\r\n                        time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by\r\n                        servants. They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their\r\n                        feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more\r\n                        tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a\r\n                        wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true; but it vanished, when\r\n                        I beheld my person reflected in water, or my shadow in the moon-shine, even\r\n                        as that frail image and that inconstant shade.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the trial\r\n                        which <tei-pb n=\"[2.109]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/109.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> in a few months I\r\n                        resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by\r\n                        reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and\r\n                        lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their\r\n                        angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream:\r\n                        no <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Eve</tei-persName> soothed my sorrows, or shared my thoughts; I was\r\n                        alone. I remembered <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Adam's</tei-persName> supplication to his Creator;\r\n                        but where was mine? He had abandoned me; and, in the bitterness of my heart,\r\n                        I cursed him.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and\r\n                        fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn\r\n                        when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the\r\n                        bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the\r\n                        endurance of cold than heat. But my chief <tei-pb n=\"[2.110]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/110.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> delights were the sight of the flowers,\r\n                        the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I\r\n                        turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not\r\n                        decreased by the absence of summer. They loved, and sympathized with one\r\n                        another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by\r\n                        the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the\r\n                        greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart\r\n                        yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures: to see their sweet\r\n                        looks turned towards me with affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition.\r\n                        I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror.\r\n                        The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I asked, it is\r\n                        true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest; I required <tei-pb n=\"[2.111]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/111.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> kindness and sympathy; but I\r\n                        did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place\r\n                        since I awoke into life. My attention, at this time, was solely directed\r\n                        towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I\r\n                        revolved many projects; but that on which I finally fixed was, to enter the\r\n                        dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to\r\n                        discover, that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object\r\n                        of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh,\r\n                        had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if, in the absence of\r\n                        his children, I could gain the good-will and mediation of the old\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">De Lacey</tei-persName>, I might, by his means, be tolerated by my\r\n                        younger protectors.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.112]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/112.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground, and\r\n                        diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth,\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName>, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName>, and\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName>, departed on a long country walk, and the old\r\n                        man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had\r\n                        departed, he took up his guitar, and played several mournful, but sweet\r\n                        airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At\r\n                        first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but, as he continued,\r\n                        thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\r\n                        instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would\r\n                        decide my hopes, or realize my fears. The servants were gone to a\r\n                        neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage: it was an\r\n                        excellent <tei-pb n=\"[2.113 - page breaks after 'oppor-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/113.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to\r\n                        execute my plan, my limbs failed me, and I sunk to the ground. Again I rose;\r\n                        and, exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks\r\n                        which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air\r\n                        revived me, and, with renewed determination, I approached the door of their\r\n                        cottage.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I knocked. <tei-said who=\"#delacey\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Who is there?\"</tei-said> said the old\r\n                           man—<tei-said who=\"#delacey\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Come in.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I entered; <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">Pardon this intrusion,</tei-said> said I, <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would\r\n                           greatly oblige me, if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before\r\n                           the fire.</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#delacey\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Enter,\"</tei-said> said <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">De Lacey</tei-persName>;\r\n                           <tei-said who=\"#delacey\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"and I will try in what manner I can relieve your\r\n                           wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and, as I am blind,\r\n                           I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for\r\n                        you.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.114]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/114.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have food;\r\n                           it is warmth and rest only that I need.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I sat down, and a silence ensued.

Oh!\r\n                        what a miserable night I passed! the cold stars shone in mockery, and the\r\n                        bare trees waved their branches above me: now and then the sweet voice of a\r\n                        bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness.

But\r\n                        I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable; and, after much\r\n                        consideration, I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by\r\n                        my representations win him to my party.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep;\r\n                        but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.\r\n                        The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes;\r\n                        the females were flying, <tei-pb n=\"[2.124]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/124.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        and the enraged <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> tearing me from his father's\r\n                        feet. I awoke exhausted; and, finding that it was already night, I crept\r\n                        forth from my hiding place, and went in search of food.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path\r\n                        that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my\r\n                        hovel, and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the\r\n                        family arose. That hour past, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the\r\n                        cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful\r\n                        misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I\r\n                        cannot describe the agony of this suspence.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they\r\n                        entered into conversation, using violent <tei-pb n=\"[2.125]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/125.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> gesticulations; but I did not understand\r\n                        what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed\r\n                        from that of my protectors.

He and his\r\n                        companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and\r\n                        then departed. I never saw any of the family of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">De\r\n                           Lacey</tei-persName> more.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and\r\n                        stupid despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only link\r\n                        that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and\r\n                        hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to controul them; but, allowing\r\n                        myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and <tei-pb n=\"[2.127]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/127.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> death. When I thought of my\r\n                        friends, of the mild voice of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">De Lacey</tei-persName>, the gentle eyes\r\n                        of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Agatha</tei-persName>, and the exquisite beauty of the\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Arabian</tei-persName>, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of\r\n                        tears somewhat soothed me. But again, when I reflected that they had spurned\r\n                        and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to injure any\r\n                        thing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced,\r\n                        I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage; and, after having\r\n                        destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced\r\n                        impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly\r\n                        dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore along\r\n                        like a mighty avelanche, and produced <tei-pb n=\"[2.128]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/128.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> a kind of insanity in my spirits, that\r\n                        burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a\r\n                        tree, and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed\r\n                        on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of\r\n                        its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sunk, and, with a loud\r\n                        scream, I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The\r\n                        wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames,\r\n                        which clung to it, and licked it with their forked and destroying\r\n                        tongues.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the\r\n                        habitation, I quitted the scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\r\n                        resolved to fly far from the scene of my <tei-pb n=\"[2.129]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/129.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> misfortunes; but to me, hated and\r\n                        despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of\r\n                        you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my\r\n                        creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had\r\n                        given me life? Among the lessons that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Felix</tei-persName> had\r\n                        bestowed upon <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Safie</tei-persName> geography had not been omitted: I\r\n                        had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of\r\n                        the earth. You had mentioned <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> as the name of your native town; and towards this\r\n                        place I resolved to proceed.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\r\n                        south-westerly direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my only\r\n                        guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor\r\n                        could I ask information from a single human <tei-pb n=\"[2.130]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/130.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> being; but I did not despair. From you\r\n                        only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but\r\n                        that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! you had endowed me with\r\n                        perceptions and passions, and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn\r\n                        and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress,\r\n                        and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to\r\n                        gain from any other being that wore the human form.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in\r\n                        autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled\r\n                        only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature\r\n                        decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around\r\n                        me; mighty rivers were <tei-pb n=\"[2.131]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/131.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        frozen; the surface of the earth was hard, and chill, and bare, and I found\r\n                        no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my\r\n                        being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to\r\n                        gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\r\n                        deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell,\r\n                        and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then\r\n                        directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide\r\n                        from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite: no incident\r\n                        occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a\r\n                        circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011731\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Switzerland</tei-placeName>, when the sun had\r\n                        recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look <tei-pb n=\"[2.132]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/132.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> green, confirmed in an especial manner\r\n                        the bitterness and horror of my feelings.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was secured by\r\n                        night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay\r\n                        through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had\r\n                        risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the\r\n                        loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of\r\n                        gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half\r\n                        surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne\r\n                        away by them; and, forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.\r\n                        Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\r\n                        thankfulness towards the <tei-pb n=\"[2.133]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/133.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\r\n                        boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of\r\n                        the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I\r\n                        paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of\r\n                        voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I\r\n                        was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot where I\r\n                        was concealed, laughing as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued\r\n                        her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot\r\n                        slipt, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding place,\r\n                        and, with extreme labour from the force of the current, saved her, and\r\n                        dragged her <tei-pb n=\"[2.134]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/134.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> to shore. She\r\n                        was senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore\r\n                        animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who\r\n                        was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he\r\n                        darted towards me, and, tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the\r\n                        deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when\r\n                        the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body, and\r\n                        fired. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness,\r\n                        escaped into the wood.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from\r\n                        destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the miserable pain of\r\n                        a wound, which shattered the flesh and bone. The <tei-pb n=\"[2.135]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/135.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> feelings of kindness and gentleness,\r\n                        which I had entertained but a few moments before, gave place to hellish rage\r\n                        and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and\r\n                        vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses\r\n                        paused, and I fainted.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the\r\n                        wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not\r\n                        whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means\r\n                        of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense\r\n                        of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for\r\n                        revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the\r\n                        outrages and anguish I had endured.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[2.136]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/136.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I\r\n                        endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes\r\n                        of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my desolate state, and\r\n                        made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of\r\n                        pleasure.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But my toils now drew near a close; and, two months from this time, I\r\n                        reached the environs of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the\r\n                        fields that surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I\r\n                        was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle\r\n                        breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous\r\n                        mountains of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1109172\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Jura</tei-placeName>.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">At this time a slight sleep relieved <tei-pb n=\"[2.137]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/137.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> me from the pain of reflection, which\r\n                        was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into\r\n                        the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I\r\n                        gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this little creature was unprejudiced,\r\n                        and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If,\r\n                        therefore, I could seize him, and educate him as my companion and friend, I\r\n                        should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him\r\n                        towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his\r\n                        eyes, and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face,\r\n                        and said, <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Child, what is the meaning of this?

I\r\n                        shall feel the affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to the\r\n                        chain of existence and events, from which I am now excluded.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various <tei-pb n=\"[2.151 - page breaks after 'argu-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/151.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he\r\n                     had displayed on the opening of his existence, and the subsequent blight of all\r\n                     kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested\r\n                     towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations: a\r\n                     creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers, and hide himself\r\n                     from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being\r\n                     possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of\r\n                     reflection, I concluded, that the justice due both to him and my\r\n                     fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning\r\n                     to him, therefore, I said—</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit\r\n                           <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000003\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Europe</tei-placeName> for ever, and\r\n                        every other place in the <tei-pb n=\"[2.152 - page breaks after 'neighbour-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/152.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\r\n                        deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your\r\n                        exile.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I swear,\"</tei-said> he cried, <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"by the\r\n                        sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, that if you grant my prayer, while they\r\n                        exist you shall never behold me again.

I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight\r\n                     of an eagle, and quickly lost him among the undulations of the sea of ice.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of the\r\n                     horizon when he departed. I knew <tei-pb n=\"[2.153]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/153.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be\r\n                     encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour\r\n                     of winding among the little paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly\r\n                     as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the\r\n                     occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to the\r\n                     half-way resting-place, and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone\r\n                     at intervals, as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before\r\n                     me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of\r\n                     wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly;\r\n                     and, clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Oh! stars,\r\n                        and clouds, and winds, ye are all about to mock <tei-pb n=\"[2.154]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/154.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> me: if ye really pity me, crush\r\n                        sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart\r\n                        and leave me in darkness.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how the\r\n                     eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened to every\r\n                     blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1032562\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Chamounix</tei-placeName>; but my presence, so haggard and\r\n                     strange, hardly calmed the fears of my family, who had waited the whole night\r\n                     in anxious expectation of my return.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The following day we returned to <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>. The intention of my father in coming had been to divert\r\n                     my mind, and to restore me to my lost tranquillity; but the medicine had been\r\n                     fatal. And, unable to account for the excess of <tei-pb n=\"[2.155]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/155.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> misery I appeared to suffer, he hastened to\r\n                     return home, hoping the quiet and monotony of a domestic life would by degrees\r\n                     alleviate my sufferings from whatsoever cause they might spring.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">For myself, I was passive in all their arrangements; and the gentle affection\r\n                     of my beloved <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> was inadequate to draw me from the\r\n                     depth of my despair. The promise I had made to the dæmon weighed upon my mind,\r\n                     like <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n78095495\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Dante</tei-persName>'s iron cowl on the\r\n                     heads of the hellish hypocrites. All pleasures of earth and sky passed before\r\n                     me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life. Can you\r\n                     wonder, that sometimes a kind of insanity possessed me, or that I saw\r\n                     continually about me a multitude of filthy animals inflicting on me incessant\r\n                     torture, that often extorted screams and bitter groans?</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[2.156]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol2/156.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">By degrees, however, these feelings became calmed.

I feared the vengeance of the disappointed\r\n                     fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was\r\n                     enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting\r\n                     several months to profound study and <tei-pb n=\"[3.2 - page breaks after 'labo-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/2.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> laborious disquisition. I had heard of some\r\n                     discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which\r\n                     was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father's\r\n                     consent to visit <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002445\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">England</tei-placeName> for\r\n                     this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and could not resolve to\r\n                     interrupt my returning tranquillity. My health, which had hitherto declined,\r\n                     was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my\r\n                     unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure,\r\n                     and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains\r\n                     of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a\r\n                     devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took\r\n                     refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole <tei-pb n=\"[3.3]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> days on the lake alone in a little boat,\r\n                     watching the clouds, and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and\r\n                     listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some\r\n                     degree of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends\r\n                     with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me\r\n                     aside, thus addressed me:—</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#father\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed\r\n                        your former pleasures, and seem to be returning to yourself.

Some short time would be\r\n                     spent in the towns of Holland, and our principal stay would be in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002445\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">England</tei-placeName>. We should return by <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000070\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">France</tei-placeName>; and it was agreed that the tour\r\n                     should occupy the space of two years.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union with\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> should take place immediately on my return to\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>. <tei-said who=\"#father\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"These two years,\"</tei-said> said he, <tei-said who=\"#father\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"will pass swiftly,\r\n                        and it will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your happiness.\r\n                        And, indeed, I earnestly desire that period to arrive, when we shall all be\r\n                        united, and neither hopes or fears arise to disturb our domestic\r\n                        calm.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I am content,\"</tei-said> I replied, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"with\r\n                           <tei-pb n=\"[3.10]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/10.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> your arrangement.

During my absence I should leave my friends\r\n                     unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks,\r\n                     exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me\r\n                     wherever I might go; and would he not accompany me to <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002445\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">England</tei-placeName>? This imagination was dreadful in itself,\r\n                     but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized\r\n                     with the idea of the <tei-pb n=\"[3.11 - page breaks after 'pos-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/11.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> possibility that the reverse of this might\r\n                     happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my\r\n                     creature, I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my\r\n                     present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me, and\r\n                     exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was in the latter end of August that I departed, to pass two years of exile.\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> approved of the reasons of my departure, and\r\n                     only regretted that she had not the same opportunities of enlarging her\r\n                     experience, and cultivating her understanding. She wept, however, as she bade\r\n                     me farewell, and entreated me to return happy and tranquil. <tei-said who=\"#elizabeth\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"We all,\"</tei-said> said she, <tei-said who=\"#elizabeth\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"depend\r\n                        upon you; and if you are miserable, what must be our feelings?\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[3.12]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/12.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing\r\n                     whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered\r\n                     only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my\r\n                     chemical instruments should be packed to go with me: for I resolved to fulfil\r\n                     my promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free man. Filled with\r\n                     dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes; but\r\n                     my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my\r\n                     travels, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many\r\n                     leagues, I arrived at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7012346\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Strasburgh</tei-placeName>, where I waited two days for\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast\r\n                     between <tei-pb n=\"[3.13]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/13.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> us! He was alive to\r\n                     every new scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more\r\n                     happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me\r\n                     the shifting colours of the landscape, and the appearances of the sky. <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"This is what it is to live,\"</tei-said> he cried, <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"now I enjoy existence!

During this voyage, we passed many willowy islands, and\r\n                     saw several beautiful towns. We staid a day at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7129524\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Manheim</tei-placeName>, and, on the fifth from our departure from\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7012346\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Strasburgh</tei-placeName>, arrived at\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7004449\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mayence</tei-placeName>.

We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of\r\n                     precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7012611\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Rhine</tei-placeName>, indeed, presents a\r\n                     singularly variegated landscape.

Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\r\n                     continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\r\n                     bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\r\n                     drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were\r\n                     my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?

But a blight had come over my\r\n                     existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they\r\n                     might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound.\r\n                     Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of\r\n                     heaven and earth; the voice of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry</tei-persName> soothed me, and I\r\n                     could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous\r\n                     faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed\r\n                     between me and my fellow-men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName>; and to\r\n                     reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with\r\n                     anguish.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But in <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName> I saw the image of my former self; he was\r\n                     inquisitive, and <tei-pb n=\"[3.23 - page breaks after 'an-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/23.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> anxious to gain experience and instruction.\r\n                     The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source\r\n                     of instruction and amusement. He was for ever busy; and the only check to his\r\n                     enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mien. I tried to conceal this as much\r\n                     as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who\r\n                     was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter\r\n                     recollection.

I now also began to collect the materials necessary\r\n                     for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of\r\n                     water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was\r\n                     an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it <tei-pb n=\"[3.24]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/24.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> caused my lips to quiver, and my\r\n                     heart to palpitate.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After passing some months in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011781\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">London</tei-placeName>, we received a letter from a person in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002444\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Scotland</tei-placeName>, who had formerly been our\r\n                     visitor at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>.

This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had\r\n                     forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory\r\n                     of that unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n83180215\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Falkland</tei-persName>, the insolent <tei-persName type=\"lcnaf\" key=\"n85115759\" cert=\"low\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"cert key type\">Gower</tei-persName>, his queen, and\r\n                     son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they might be\r\n                     supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and\r\n                     we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an\r\n                     imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself\r\n                     sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and\r\n                     picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which\r\n                     flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a\r\n                        <tei-pb n=\"[3.27]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/27.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> placid expanse of waters,\r\n                     which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes,\r\n                     embosomed among aged trees.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of\r\n                     the past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful\r\n                     happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I\r\n                     was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the\r\n                     study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always\r\n                     interest my heart, and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted\r\n                     tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to\r\n                     exhibit, what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked\r\n                     humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent to myself.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[3.28]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/28.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We passed a considerable period at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011931\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Oxford</tei-placeName>, rambling among its environs, and endeavouring to\r\n                     identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of\r\n                        <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">English</tei-foreign> history.

For an instant I dared to\r\n                     shake off my chains, and look around me with a free and lofty spirit; but the\r\n                     iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\r\n                     miserable self.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We left <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011931\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Oxford</tei-placeName> with regret, and\r\n                        <tei-pb n=\"[3.29 - page breaks after 'pro-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/29.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     proceeded to <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1030005\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Matlock</tei-placeName>, which was\r\n                     our next place of rest.

The delight of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName> was proportionably\r\n                     greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he\r\n                     found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\r\n                     imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.\r\n                        <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I could pass my life here,\"</tei-said> said he to me;\r\n                        <tei-said who=\"#clerval\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"and among these mountains I should scarcely regret\r\n                           <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011731\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Switzerland</tei-placeName> and the\r\n                           <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7012611\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Rhine</tei-placeName>.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its\r\n                     enjoyments.

It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly\r\n                     more than a rock, whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.\r\n                     The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and\r\n                     oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and\r\n                     scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when\r\n                     they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\r\n                     the main land, which was about five miles distant.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">On the whole island there were but <tei-pb n=\"[3.36]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/36.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I\r\n                     hired. It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of\r\n                     the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were\r\n                     unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired,\r\n                     bought some furniture, and took possession; an incident which would, doubtless,\r\n                     have occasioned some surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been\r\n                     benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and\r\n                     unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave;\r\n                     so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the\r\n                     weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea, to listen to the <tei-pb n=\"[3.37]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/37.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> waves as they roared, and dashed\r\n                     at my feet. It was a monotonous, yet ever-changing scene. I thought of\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011731\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Switzerland</tei-placeName>; it was far\r\n                     different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered\r\n                     with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair\r\n                     lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their\r\n                     tumult is but as the play of a lively infant, when compared to the roarings of\r\n                     the giant ocean.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but, as I\r\n                     proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.\r\n                     Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several\r\n                     days; and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.\r\n                     It was indeed a filthy process in which I was engaged. During <tei-pb n=\"[3.38]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/38.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic\r\n                     frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently\r\n                     fixed on the sequel of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my\r\n                     proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at\r\n                     the work of my hands.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a\r\n                     solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual\r\n                     scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and\r\n                     nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my\r\n                     eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the\r\n                     object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of\r\n                     my fellow-creatures, <tei-pb n=\"[3.39]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/39.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> lest when\r\n                     alone he should come to claim his companion.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.\r\n                     I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared\r\n                     not trust myself to question, but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings\r\n                     of evil, that made my heart sicken in my bosom.</tei-p>\"</tei-said>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </tei-div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <tei-div n=\"3.3\" type=\"chapter\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"type n\">\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[3.40]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/40.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-head data-origname=\"head\">Chapter III</tei-head>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\" <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I SAT one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the\r\n                     moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my\r\n                     employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I\r\n                     should leave my labour for the night, or hasten its conclusion by an\r\n                     unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me,\r\n                     which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years\r\n                     before I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend whose\r\n                     unparalleled barbarity had desolated my <tei-pb n=\"[3.41]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/41.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> heart, and filled it for ever with the\r\n                     bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions\r\n                     I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than\r\n                     her mate, and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had\r\n                     sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but she\r\n                     had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning\r\n                     animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They\r\n                     might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own\r\n                     deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came\r\n                     before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him\r\n                     to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone,\r\n                     exasperated by the fresh <tei-pb n=\"[3.42]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/42.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. Even if they were to\r\n                     leave <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000003\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Europe</tei-placeName>, and inhabit the\r\n                     deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for\r\n                     which the dæmon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be\r\n                     propagated upon the earth, who might make the very existence of the species of\r\n                     man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,\r\n                     to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved by\r\n                     the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his\r\n                     fiendish threats: but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise\r\n                     burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their\r\n                     pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at <tei-pb n=\"[3.43]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/43.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the price perhaps of the\r\n                     existence of the whole human race.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw, by the\r\n                     light of the moon, the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips\r\n                     as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.\r\n                     Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself\r\n                     in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my\r\n                     progress, and claim the fulfillment of my promise.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and\r\n                     treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating\r\n                     another like him, and, trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on\r\n                     which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on <tei-pb n=\"[3.44]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/44.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> whose future existence he depended for\r\n                     happiness, and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never\r\n                     to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own\r\n                     apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve\r\n                     me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was\r\n                     almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the\r\n                     eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now\r\n                     and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices, as the fishermen called\r\n                     to one another. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its\r\n                     extreme profundity, <tei-pb n=\"[3.45]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/45.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> until my ear\r\n                     was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person\r\n                     landed close to my house.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\r\n                     endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\r\n                     presentiment of who it was, and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt\r\n                     in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of\r\n                     helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to\r\n                     fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened,\r\n                     and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me,\r\n                     and said, in a smothered voice—</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"You have destroyed the work <tei-pb n=\"[3.46]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/46.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> which you began; what is it that you\r\n                        intend?

I walked\r\n                     up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a\r\n                     thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not followed him, and closed\r\n                     with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him to depart, and he had\r\n                     directed his course towards the main land.

And then I thought again of his words—<tei-said who=\"#creatureVictor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I\r\n                        will be with you on your wedding-night.\"</tei-said> That then was the period\r\n                     fixed for the fulfillment of my destiny. In that hour I should die, and at once\r\n                     satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet\r\n                     when I thought of my beloved <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>,—of her tears and\r\n                     endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from\r\n                     her,—tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I\r\n                     resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\r\n                     calmer, if it may be called calmness, when the violence of rage sinks into the\r\n                     depths of despair. I left the <tei-pb n=\"[3.51]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/51.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     house, the horrid scene of the last night's contention, and walked on the beach\r\n                     of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my\r\n                     fellow-creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.\r\n                     I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily it is true,\r\n                     but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be\r\n                     sacrificed, or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon\r\n                     whom I had myself created.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved,\r\n                     and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher,\r\n                     I lay down on the grass, and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake\r\n                     the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, <tei-pb n=\"[3.52]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/52.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.\r\n                     The sleep into which I now sunk refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\r\n                     if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect\r\n                     upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend\r\n                     rung in my ears like a death-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct\r\n                     and oppressive as a reality.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\r\n                     appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\r\n                     fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it\r\n                     contained letters from <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> ,\r\n                     and one from <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>, entreating me to join him. He said\r\n                     that nearly a year had elapsed since we had quitted <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7011731\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Switzerland</tei-placeName>, and <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000070\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">France</tei-placeName> was yet unvisited. He <tei-pb n=\"[3.53 - page breaks after 'en-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/53.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     entreated me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle, and meet him at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7009702\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Perth</tei-placeName>, in a week from that time, when\r\n                     we might arrange the plan of our future proceedings. This letter in a degree\r\n                     recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of\r\n                     two days.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to\r\n                     reflect: I must pack my chemical instruments; and for that purpose I must enter\r\n                     the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those\r\n                     utensils, the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at\r\n                     day-break, I summoned sufficient courage, and unlocked the door of my\r\n                     laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed,\r\n                     lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had <tei-pb n=\"[3.54 - page breaks after 'man-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/54.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself, and then\r\n                     entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the\r\n                     room; but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite\r\n                     the horror and suspicion of the peasants, and I accordingly put them into a\r\n                     basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to\r\n                     throw them into the sea that very night; and in the mean time I sat upon the\r\n                     beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my\r\n                     feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded\r\n                     my promise with a gloomy despair, as a thing that, with whatever consequences,\r\n                     must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had <tei-pb n=\"[3.55]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/55.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> been taken from before my eyes, and that I,\r\n                     for the first time, saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for\r\n                     one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I\r\n                     did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\r\n                     my own mind, that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an\r\n                     act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I banished from my mind\r\n                     every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\r\n                     basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The\r\n                     scene was perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I\r\n                     sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful\r\n                     crime, and avoided with shuddering <tei-pb n=\"[3.56]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/56.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> anxiety any encounter with my fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which\r\n                     had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took\r\n                     advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my basket into the sea; I\r\n                     listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away from the spot.\r\n                     The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the\r\n                     north-east breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with\r\n                     such agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and\r\n                     fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the\r\n                     boat. Clouds hid the moon, every thing was obscure, and I heard only the sound\r\n                     of the boat, as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a\r\n                     short time I slept soundly.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[3.57]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/57.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found\r\n                     that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves\r\n                     continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was\r\n                     north-east, and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had\r\n                     embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but quickly found that if I again\r\n                     made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated,\r\n                     my only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few\r\n                     sensations of terror. I had no compass with me, and was so little acquainted\r\n                     with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit\r\n                     to me. I might be driven into the wide <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7014206\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Atlantic</tei-placeName>, and feel all the tortures of starvation, or be\r\n                     swallowed up in the immeasurable <tei-pb n=\"[3.58]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/58.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours,\r\n                     and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I\r\n                     looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind\r\n                     only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the sea, it was to be my grave.\r\n                        <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Fiend,\"</tei-said> I exclaimed, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"your\r\n                        task is already fulfilled!\"</tei-said> I thought of\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, of my father, and of\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>; and sunk into a reverie, so despairing and\r\n                     frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me\r\n                     for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\r\n                     horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze, and the sea became free from\r\n                     breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick, and hardly able\r\n                     to hold the rudder, when suddenly <tei-pb n=\"[3.59]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/59.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> I saw a line of high land towards the south.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense I endured for\r\n                     several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to\r\n                     my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of\r\n                     life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a part of my\r\n                     dress, and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky\r\n                     appearance; but, as I approached nearer, I easily perceived the traces of\r\n                     cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore, and found myself suddenly\r\n                     transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man. I eagerly traced the\r\n                     windings of the land, and hailed a steeple which I at length saw <tei-pb n=\"[3.60]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/60.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> issuing from behind a small promontory. As I\r\n                     was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the\r\n                     town as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I\r\n                     had money with me. As I turned the promontory, I perceived a small neat town\r\n                     and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my\r\n                     unexpected escape.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people\r\n                     crowded towards the spot. They seemed very much surprised at my appearance;\r\n                     but, instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures\r\n                     that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.\r\n                     As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English; and I therefore addressed\r\n                     them in that language: <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"My good friends,\"</tei-said> said I,\r\n                        <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"will you be so <tei-pb n=\"[3.61]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/61.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> kind as to tell me the name of this town,\r\n                        and inform me where I am?\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#unknown\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"You will know that soon enough,\"</tei-said> replied a man\r\n                     with a gruff voice. <tei-said who=\"#unknown\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"May be you are come to a place that\r\n                        will not prove much to your taste; but you will not be consulted as to your\r\n                        quarters, I promise you.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger; and\r\n                     I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of\r\n                     his companions. <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Why do you answer me so roughly?\"</tei-said> I\r\n                     replied: <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\r\n                        receive strangers so inhospitably.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#unknown\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I do not know,\"</tei-said> said the man, <tei-said who=\"#unknown\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"what the custom of the <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">English</tei-foreign> may be; but it is the\r\n                        custom of the Irish to hate villains.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">While this strange dialogue <tei-pb n=\"[3.62 - page breaks after 'conti-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/62.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\r\n                     increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\r\n                     annoyed, and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn; but no\r\n                     one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd\r\n                     as they followed and surrounded me; when an ill-looking man approaching, tapped\r\n                     me on the shoulder, and said, <tei-said who=\"#unknown\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Come, Sir, you must follow\r\n                        me to <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr.Kirwin’s</tei-persName>.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Who is <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Kirwin</tei-persName>?

I was innocent;\r\n                     that could easily be proved: accordingly I followed my conductor in silence,\r\n                     and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\r\n                     fatigue and hunger; but, being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to\r\n                     rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\r\n                     apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was\r\n                     in a few moments to overwhelm me, and extinguish in horror and despair all fear\r\n                     of ignominy or death.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to\r\n                        recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in\r\n                        proper detail, to my recollection.\"</tei-said></tei-p></tei-said>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </tei-div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <tei-div n=\"3.4\" type=\"chapter\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"type n\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[3.64]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/64.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-head data-origname=\"head\">Chapter IV</tei-head>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I WAS soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an\r\n                     old benevolent man, with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\r\n                     with some degree of severity; and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked\r\n                     who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">About half a dozen men came forward; and one being selected by the magistrate,\r\n                     he deposed, that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and\r\n                     brother-in-law, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Daniel Nugent </tei-persName>, when, about ten o'clock,\r\n                     they <tei-pb n=\"[3.65 - page breaks after 'ob-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/65.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port.\r\n                     It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at\r\n                     the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles\r\n                     below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his\r\n                     companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands,\r\n                     he struck his foot against something, and fell at his length on the ground. His\r\n                     companions came up to assist him; and, by the light of their lantern, they\r\n                     found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.\r\n                     Their first supposition was, that it was the corpse of some person who had been\r\n                     drowned, and was thrown on shore by the waves; but, upon examination, they\r\n                     found that the clothes were not wet, and even that <tei-pb n=\"[3.66]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/66.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the body was not then cold. They instantly\r\n                     carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot, and endeavoured, but\r\n                     in vain, to restore it to life. He appeared to be a handsome young man, about\r\n                     five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled; for there was\r\n                     no sign of any violence, except the black mark of fingers on his neck.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but when\r\n                     the mark of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of my brother,\r\n                     and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my\r\n                     eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed\r\n                     me with a keen eye, and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my\r\n                     manner.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The son confirmed his father's <tei-pb n=\"[3.67 - page breaks after 'ac-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/67.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> account: but when <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\"> Daniel\r\n                        Nugent</tei-persName> was called, he swore positively that, just before the fall\r\n                     of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance\r\n                     from the shore; and, as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it\r\n                     was the same boat in which I had just landed.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">A woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and was standing at the door of\r\n                     her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she\r\n                     heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat, with only one man in\r\n                     it, push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards\r\n                     found.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body\r\n                     into her house; it was not cold.

Besides, they observed that\r\n                     it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely,\r\n                     that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour\r\n                     ignorant of the distance of the town of ---- from the place where I had\r\n                     deposited the corpse.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\r\n                     <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Kirwin</tei-persName>, on hearing this evidence, desired that I\r\n                     should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might\r\n                     be observed <tei-pb n=\"[3.69]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/69.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> what effect the\r\n                     sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the\r\n                     extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been\r\n                     described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other\r\n                     persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences\r\n                     that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been\r\n                     conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time\r\n                     that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences\r\n                     of the affair.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I entered the room where the corpse lay, and was led up to the coffin. How can\r\n                     I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor\r\n                     can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony, <tei-pb n=\"[3.70]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/70.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> that faintly reminds me of the\r\n                     anguish of recognition. The trial, the presence of the magistrate and\r\n                     witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory, when I saw the lifeless form of\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry Clerval</tei-persName> stretched before me.

Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist\r\n                     me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and, at others, I\r\n                     felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud\r\n                     with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language,\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Kirwin</tei-persName> alone understood me; but my gestures and\r\n                     bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Why did I not die?

Of what materials was <tei-pb n=\"[3.72]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/72.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> I made, that I could thus resist so many\r\n                     shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the\r\n                     torture.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as awaking from a\r\n                     dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers,\r\n                     turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning,\r\n                     I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding: I had forgotten the particulars\r\n                     of what had happened, and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly\r\n                     overwhelmed me; but when I looked around, and saw the barred windows, and the\r\n                     squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory, and I\r\n                     groaned bitterly.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. <tei-pb n=\"[3.73]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/73.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> She was a hired nurse, the wife\r\n                     of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities\r\n                     which often characterise that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude,\r\n                     like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of\r\n                     misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in\r\n                        <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">English</tei-foreign>, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard\r\n                     during my sufferings:</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#oldwoman\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Are you better now, Sir?\"</tei-said> said she.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I\r\n                        believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry\r\n                        that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#oldwoman\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"For that matter,\"</tei-said> replied the old woman, <tei-said who=\"#oldwoman\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe\r\n                        that it were better for you if you were dead, <tei-pb n=\"[3.74]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/74.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> for I fancy it will go hard with you; but\r\n                        you will be hung when the next sessions come on.

The whole series of my life appeared to me\r\n                     as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never\r\n                     presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a\r\n                     darkness pressed around me: no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle\r\n                     voice of love; no dear hand supported me.<tei-pb n=\"[3.75]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/75.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> The physician came and prescribed medicines,\r\n                     and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in\r\n                     the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of\r\n                     the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman\r\n                     who would gain his fee?</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These were my first reflections; but I soon learned that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr.\r\n                        Kirwin</tei-persName> had shewn me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room\r\n                     in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was\r\n                     he who had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see\r\n                     me; for, although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human\r\n                     creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of\r\n                     a murderer. He came, therefore, <tei-pb n=\"[3.76 - page breaks after 'some-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/76.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> sometimes to see that I was not neglected;\r\n                     but his visits were short, and at long intervals.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">One day, when I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half\r\n                     open, and my cheeks livid like those in death, I was overcome by gloom and\r\n                     misery, and often reflected I had better seek death than remain miserably pent\r\n                     up only to be let loose in a world replete with wretchedness. At one time I\r\n                     considered whether I should not declare myself guilty, and suffer the penalty\r\n                     of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts,\r\n                     when the door of my apartment was opened, and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Kirwin</tei-persName>\r\n                     entered.

But the appearance of my\r\n                     father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my\r\n                     health.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[3.83]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/83.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy,\r\n                     that nothing could dissipate. The image of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName> was for\r\n                     ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which\r\n                     these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! why\r\n                     did they preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might\r\n                     fulfill my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will\r\n                     death extinguish these throbbings, and relieve me from the mighty weight of\r\n                     anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I\r\n                     shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\r\n                     wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and\r\n                     speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might <tei-pb n=\"[3.84]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/84.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in\r\n                     prison; and although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a relapse, I\r\n                     was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the county-town, where the\r\n                     court was held. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Kirwin</tei-persName> charged himself with every care\r\n                     of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace of\r\n                     appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court\r\n                     that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being\r\n                     proved that I was on the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7459637\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Orkney\r\n                        Islands</tei-placeName> at the hour the body of my friend was found, and a\r\n                     fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a <tei-pb n=\"[3.85 - page breaks after 'cri-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/85.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere, and\r\n                     allowed to return to my native country. I did not participate in these\r\n                     feelings; for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The\r\n                     cup of life was poisoned for ever; and although the sun shone upon me, as upon\r\n                     the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful\r\n                     darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon\r\n                     me. Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Henry</tei-persName>,\r\n                     languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids, and the long\r\n                     black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the\r\n                     monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of <tei-pb n=\"[3.86]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/86.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>, which I should soon\r\n                     visit—of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName>; but\r\n                     these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for\r\n                     happiness; and thought, with melancholy delight, of my beloved cousin; or\r\n                     longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more the blue lake and\r\n                     rapid <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7023890\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Rhone</tei-placeName>, that had been so\r\n                     dear to me in early childhood: but my general state of feeling was a torpor, in\r\n                     which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\r\n                     these fits were seldom interrupted, but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At\r\n                     these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed; and\r\n                     it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing\r\n                     some dreadful act of violence.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I remember, as I quitted the prison, <tei-pb n=\"[3.87]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/87.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> I heard one of the men say, <tei-said who=\"#unknown\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"He may be innocent of the murder, but he has certainly a bad\r\n                        conscience.\"</tei-said> These words struck me.

I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy\r\n                     weight, when the packet sailed with a fair wind from Ireland, and I had quitted\r\n                     for ever the country which had been to me the scene of so much misery.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was midnight. My father slept in <tei-pb n=\"[3.88]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/88.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the cabin; and I lay on the deck, looking at\r\n                     the stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness\r\n                     that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy, when I\r\n                     reflected that I should soon see <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful\r\n                     dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\r\n                     shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I\r\n                     was deceived by no vision, and that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>, my friend and\r\n                     dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\r\n                     repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with\r\n                     my family in <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>, the death\r\n                     of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered shuddering at the\r\n                     mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the <tei-pb n=\"[3.89 - page breaks after 'crea-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/89.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night during which he\r\n                     first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings\r\n                     pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every\r\n                     night a small quantity of laudanum; for it was by means of this drug only that\r\n                     I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life.\r\n                     Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now took a double\r\n                     dose, and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me respite from\r\n                     thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.\r\n                     Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of night-mare; I felt the fiend's\r\n                     grasp in my neck, and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rung in\r\n                     my ears.

We were told this when young, and taught to\r\n                        look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were\r\n                        affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued\r\n                        friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often\r\n                        entertain a lively affection towards each other, without desiring a more\r\n                        intimate union, may not such also be our case?

But this is false\r\n                        reasoning. I confess to you, my cousin, that I love you, and that in my airy\r\n                        dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. But it is\r\n                        your happiness I desire as well as my own, when I declare to you, that our\r\n                        marriage would render me eternally miserable, unless it were the dictate of\r\n                        your own free choice. Even now I weep to think, that, borne down as you are\r\n                        by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word honour, all hope\r\n                        of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who\r\n                        have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\r\n                        ten-fold by being an obstacle to your wishes.

On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death.\r\n                  Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he\r\n                  was victorious, I should be at peace, and his power over me be at an end. If he\r\n                  were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! what freedom? such as the peasant\r\n                  enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his\r\n                  lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, pennyless, and alone, but\r\n                  free. Such would be my liberty, except that in my <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> I\r\n                  possessed a treasure; alas! balanced <tei-pb n=\"[3.102]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/102.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> by those horrors of remorse and guilt, which\r\n                  would pursue me until death.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Sweet and beloved <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>! I read and re-read her letter,\r\n                  and some softened feelings stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical\r\n                  dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel's arm bared\r\n                  to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster\r\n                  executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my\r\n                  marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months\r\n                  sooner; but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his\r\n                  menaces, he would surely find other, and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.\r\n                  He had vowed to be with me on my wedding-night, yet he did not consider that\r\n                  threat as binding him to peace in <tei-pb n=\"[3.103]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/103.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  the mean time; for, as if to shew me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he\r\n                  had murdered <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName> immediately after the enunciation of his\r\n                  threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would\r\n                  conduce either to her's or my father's happiness, my adversary's designs against\r\n                  my life should not retard it a single hour.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In this state of mind I wrote to <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>.

But until then, I conjure\r\n                     you, do not mention or allude to it.

My cousin\r\n                  welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her eyes, as she beheld my\r\n                  emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner,\r\n                  and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her\r\n                  gentleness, and soft looks of compassion, made her a more fit companion for one\r\n                  blasted and miserable as I was.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[3.105]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/105.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.

I neither spoke\r\n                  or looked, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that\r\n                  overcame me.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her\r\n                  gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion, and inspire me with\r\n                  human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me, and for me. When reason\r\n                  returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah!\r\n                  it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no\r\n                  peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is <tei-pb n=\"[3.106]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/106.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> otherwise sometimes found in indulging the\r\n                  excess of grief.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with my cousin.

But\r\n                  death was no evil to me, if the loss of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> were\r\n                  balanced with it; and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance,\r\n                  agreed with my father, that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take\r\n                  place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Great God! if for one instant I <tei-pb n=\"[3.108]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/108.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would\r\n                  rather have banished myself for ever from my native country, and wandered a\r\n                  friendless outcast over the earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage.\r\n                  But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\r\n                  intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened\r\n                  that of a far dearer victim.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a\r\n                  prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by\r\n                  an appearance of hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my\r\n                  father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of\r\n                     <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>. She looked forward to our union with placid\r\n                  contentment, not <tei-pb n=\"[3.109]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/109.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> unmingled with a\r\n                  little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain\r\n                  and tangible happiness, might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no\r\n                  trace but deep and everlasting regret.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were received; and all\r\n                  wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the\r\n                  anxiety that preyed there, and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of\r\n                  my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. A\r\n                  house was purchased for us near <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7004446\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Cologne</tei-placeName>, by which we should enjoy the pleasures of the country,\r\n                  and yet be so near <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> as to\r\n                  see my father every day; who would still reside within the walls, for the benefit\r\n                  of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName>, that he might follow his studies at the\r\n                  schools.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-pb n=\"[3.110]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/110.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In the mean time I took every precaution to defend my person, in case the fiend\r\n                  should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me, and\r\n                  was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and by these means gained a greater\r\n                  degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more\r\n                  as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the\r\n                  happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty, as\r\n                  the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken\r\n                  of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed\r\n                  greatly to calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfill my wishes and my\r\n                  destiny, she was melancholy, and <tei-pb n=\"[3.111]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/111.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful\r\n                  secret, which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was\r\n                  in the mean time overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only observed in\r\n                  the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my father's; but it\r\n                  was agreed that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> and I should pass the afternoon and\r\n                  night at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7009171\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Evian</tei-placeName>, and return to\r\n                     <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7004446\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Cologne</tei-placeName> the next morning.

We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from\r\n                  its rays by a kind of canopy, while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, <tei-pb n=\"[3.112]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/112.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> sometimes on one side of the lake,\r\n                  where we saw <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1106285\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mont Salêve</tei-placeName>, the\r\n                  pleasant banks of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1032711\" cert=\"medium\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"cert key type\">Montalêgre</tei-placeName>, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful\r\n                     <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7617157\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mont Blânc</tei-placeName>, and the assemblage\r\n                  of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\r\n                  opposite banks, we saw the mighty <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1109172\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Jura</tei-placeName> opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its\r\n                  native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should\r\n                  wish to enslave it.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I took the hand of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>: <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"You are\r\n                     sorrowful, my love.

I rushed towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the deathly\r\n                     languor and coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now held in my arms had\r\n                     ceased to be the <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> whom I had loved and cherished.\r\n                     The <tei-pb n=\"[3.121]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/121.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> murderous mark of the\r\n                     fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her\r\n                     lips.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The\r\n                     windows of the room had before been darkened; and I felt a kind of panic on\r\n                     seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters\r\n                     had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of horror not to be described, I\r\n                     saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on\r\n                     the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he\r\n                     pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing\r\n                     a pistol from my bosom, shot; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and,\r\n                     running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[3.122]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/122.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot\r\n                     where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast,\r\n                     but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my\r\n                     companions believing it to have been a form conjured by my fancy. After having\r\n                     landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different\r\n                     directions among the woods and vines.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I did not accompany them; I was exhausted: a film covered my eyes, and my skin\r\n                     was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed, hardly\r\n                     conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek\r\n                     something that I had lost.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">At length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the return <tei-pb n=\"[3.123]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/123.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> of\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName> and myself, and that I must return alone.\r\n                     This reflection brought tears into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; but my\r\n                     thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting on my misfortunes, and their\r\n                     cause. I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName>, the execution of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Justine</tei-persName>,\r\n                     the murder of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName>, and lastly of my wife; even at that\r\n                     moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity\r\n                     of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName> might be dead at his feet. This idea made me\r\n                     shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to return to\r\n                        <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> with all possible\r\n                     speed.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\r\n                     wind was unfavourable, and <tei-pb n=\"[3.124]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/124.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the\r\n                     rain fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably\r\n                     hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row, and took an oar myself, for I had\r\n                     always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the\r\n                     overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured,\r\n                     rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; and, leaning my\r\n                     head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I\r\n                     saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which I had\r\n                     contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow\r\n                     and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a\r\n                     moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours\r\n                     before; they had then been observed <tei-pb n=\"[3.125]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/125.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> by <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>. Nothing\r\n                     is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might\r\n                     shine, or the clouds might lour; but nothing could appear to me as it had done\r\n                     the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness: no\r\n                     creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single\r\n                     in the history of man.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming\r\n                     event. Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I\r\n                     must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends\r\n                     were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I\r\n                     must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I arrived at <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>. My father\r\n                     and <tei-pb n=\"[3.126]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/126.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ernest</tei-persName> yet lived; but the former sunk under the tidings\r\n                     that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! his eyes wandered\r\n                     in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight—his niece, his more\r\n                     than daughter, whom he doated on with all that affection which a man feels,\r\n                     who,in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to\r\n                     those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey\r\n                     hairs, and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the\r\n                     horrors that were accumulated around him; an apoplectic fit was brought on, and\r\n                     in a few days he died in my arms.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness\r\n                     were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I\r\n                     wandered in flowery <tei-pb n=\"[3.127]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/127.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> meadows\r\n                     and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; but awoke, and found myself in\r\n                     a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of\r\n                     my miseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they had\r\n                     called me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had\r\n                     been my habitation.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But liberty had been a useless gift to me had I not, as I awakened to reason,\r\n                     at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed\r\n                     upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the\r\n                     miserable daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I\r\n                     was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and\r\n                     ardently prayed that I might have him <tei-pb n=\"[3.128]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/128.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\r\n                     revenge on his cursed head.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on\r\n                     the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my\r\n                     release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an\r\n                     accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required\r\n                     him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness: <tei-said who=\"#magistrate\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Be assured, sir,\"</tei-said> said he, <tei-said who=\"#magistrate\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the\r\n                        villain.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I thank you,\"</tei-said> replied I; <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a\r\n                        tale so strange, that I should fear you would not credit <tei-pb n=\"[3.129]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/129.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> it, were there not something in truth\r\n                        which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\r\n                        be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.\"</tei-said> My\r\n                     manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but calm; I had formed in my\r\n                     own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and this purpose\r\n                     quieted my agony, and provisionally reconciled me to life. I now related my\r\n                     history briefly, but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\r\n                     accuracy, and never deviating into invective or exclamation.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he\r\n                     became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror,\r\n                     at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his\r\n                     countenance.</tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-pb n=\"[3.130]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/130.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When I had concluded my narration, I said, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"This is the\r\n                        being whom I accuse, and for whose detection and punishment I call upon you\r\n                        to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe\r\n                        and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of\r\n                        those functions on this occasion.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my auditor. He\r\n                     had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of\r\n                     spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially\r\n                     in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however,\r\n                     answered mildly, <tei-said who=\"#magistrate\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I would willingly afford you every\r\n                        aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have\r\n                        powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. <tei-pb n=\"[3.131]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/131.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> Who can follow an animal which can\r\n                        traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and dens, where no man would\r\n                        venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission\r\n                        of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or\r\n                        what region he may now inhabit.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I\r\n                        inhabit; and if he has indeed taken refuge in the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7007746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Alps</tei-placeName>, he may be hunted like the chamois, and\r\n                        destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not\r\n                        credit my narrative, and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\r\n                        punishment which is his desert.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated; <tei-said who=\"#magistrate\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"You are mistaken,\"</tei-said> said he, <tei-said who=\"#magistrate\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I will <tei-pb n=\"[3.132]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/132.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        exert myself; if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he\r\n                        shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.

I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\r\n                        endowed me with strength and composure; it modelled my feelings, and allowed\r\n                        me to be calculating and calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death\r\n                        would have been my portion.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My first resolution was to quit <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName> for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and\r\n                        beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided\r\n                        myself with <tei-pb n=\"[3.135]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/135.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> a sum of money,\r\n                        together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and\r\n                        departed.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have\r\n                        traversed a vast portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships\r\n                        which travellers, in deserts and barbarous countries, are wont to meet. How\r\n                        I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs\r\n                        upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I\r\n                        dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When I quitted <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7003746\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Geneva</tei-placeName>, my\r\n                        first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my\r\n                        fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled; and I wandered many hours around\r\n                        the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night <tei-pb n=\"[3.136]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/136.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> approached, I found myself\r\n                        at the entrance of the cemetery where <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">William</tei-persName>,\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>, and my father, reposed. I entered it, and\r\n                        approached the tomb which marked their graves. Every thing was silent,\r\n                        except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the\r\n                        night was nearly dark; and the scene would have been solemn and affecting\r\n                        even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit\r\n                        around, and to cast a shadow, which was felt but seen not, around the head\r\n                        of the mourner.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\r\n                        rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\r\n                        and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass,\r\n                        and kissed the earth, and with <tei-pb n=\"[3.137 - page breaks after 'quiver-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/137.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> quivering lips exclaimed, <tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that\r\n                           wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and\r\n                           by thee, O Night, and by the spirits that preside over thee, I swear to\r\n                           pursue the daemon, who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in\r\n                           mortal conflict.

Surely in that\r\n                        moment I should have been possessed by phrenzy, and have destroyed my\r\n                        miserable existence, but that my vow was heard, and that I was reserved for\r\n                        vengeance. The laughter died away: when a well-known and abhorred voice,\r\n                        apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper—<tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"I am satisfied: miserable wretch! you have determined to\r\n                           live, and I am satisfied.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[3.139]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/139.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded; but the devil\r\n                        eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and shone full\r\n                        upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than mortal\r\n                        speed.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight\r\n                        clue, I followed the windings of the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7023890\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Rhone</tei-placeName>, but vainly. The blue <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7016735\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mediterranean</tei-placeName> appeared; and, by a strange\r\n                        chance, I saw the fiend enter by night, and hide himself in a vessel bound\r\n                        for the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7016619\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Black Sea</tei-placeName>. I took my\r\n                        passage in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not how.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Amidst the wilds of <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7016836\" cert=\"medium\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"cert key type\">Tartary</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002435\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Russia</tei-placeName>, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in\r\n                        his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition,\r\n                        informed me of his <tei-pb n=\"[3.140]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/140.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> path;\r\n                        sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace I should despair\r\n                        and die, often left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head,\r\n                        and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first\r\n                        entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how can you\r\n                        understand what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were\r\n                        the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil,\r\n                        and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\r\n                        followed and directed my steps, and, when I most murmured, would suddenly\r\n                        extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when\r\n                        nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared\r\n                        for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited me. The fare was indeed\r\n                           <tei-pb n=\"[3.141]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/141.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> coarse, such as the\r\n                        peasants of the country ate; but I may not doubt that it was set there by\r\n                        the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the\r\n                        heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim\r\n                        the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon\r\n                        generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country\r\n                        chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen; and I\r\n                        generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money\r\n                        with me, and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it, or\r\n                        bringing with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small\r\n                        part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils\r\n                        for cooking.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[3.142]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/142.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\r\n                        sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when most\r\n                        miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\r\n                        spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\r\n                        happiness, that I might retain strength to fulfill my pilgrimage. Deprived\r\n                        of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\r\n                        sustained and inspirited by the hope of night: for in sleep I saw my\r\n                        friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\r\n                        countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Elizabeth</tei-persName>'s voice, and beheld\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Clerval</tei-persName> enjoying health and youth. Often, when\r\n                        wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until\r\n                        night should come, and <tei-pb n=\"[3.143]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/143.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> that\r\n                        I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What\r\n                        agonizing fondness did I feel for them! how did I cling to their dear forms,\r\n                        as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that\r\n                        they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in\r\n                        my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the daemon, more\r\n                        as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of\r\n                        which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">What his feelings were whom I pursued, I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\r\n                        left marks in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone, that\r\n                        guided me, and instigated my fury. <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"My reign is not\r\n                           yet over,\"</tei-said> (these words were legible in one of these\r\n                        inscriptions); <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"you live, and my power is <tei-pb n=\"[3.144]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/144.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> complete.

The peasants <tei-pb n=\"[3.145]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/145.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> were shut up in their\r\n                        hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals\r\n                        whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. The\r\n                        rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was\r\n                        cut off from my chief article of maintenance.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\r\n                        inscription that he left was in these words: <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Prepare!\r\n                           your toils only begin: wrap yourself in furs, and provide food, for we\r\n                           shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my\r\n                           everlasting hatred.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\r\n                        resolved not to fail in my purpose; and, calling on heaven to support me, I\r\n                        continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the <tei-pb n=\"[3.146]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/146.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> ocean appeared at a\r\n                        distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! how unlike it\r\n                        was to the blue seas of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be\r\n                        distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The\r\n                           <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">Greeks</tei-foreign> wept for joy when they beheld the <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7016735\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Mediterranean</tei-placeName> from the hills of\r\n                           <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"1000004\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">Asia</tei-placeName>, and hailed with\r\n                        rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep; but I knelt down, and,\r\n                        with a full heart, thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to\r\n                        the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe, to meet and\r\n                        grapple with him.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs, and thus\r\n                        traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend\r\n                        possessed the same advantages; but I found that, as before I had <tei-pb n=\"[3.147]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/147.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> daily lost ground in the\r\n                        pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so, that when I first saw the ocean,\r\n                        he was but one day's journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before\r\n                        he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in\r\n                        two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the sea-shore. I inquired of the\r\n                        inhabitants concerning the fiend, and gained accurate information. A\r\n                        gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun\r\n                        and many pistols; putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage,\r\n                        through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of\r\n                        winter food, and, placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\r\n                        numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night,\r\n                        to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey <tei-pb n=\"[3.148]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/148.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> across the sea in a\r\n                        direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be\r\n                        destroyed by the breaking of the ice, or frozen by the eternal frosts.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">On hearing this information, I suffered a temporary access of despair. He\r\n                        had escaped me; and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey\r\n                        across the mountainous ices of the ocean,—amidst cold that few of the\r\n                        inhabitants could long endure, and which I, the native of a genial and sunny\r\n                        climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should\r\n                        live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and, like a mighty\r\n                        tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which\r\n                        the spirits of the dead hovered round, and instigated me to toil and\r\n                        revenge, I prepared for my journey.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-pb n=\"[3.149]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/149.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I exchanged my land sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the\r\n                        frozen ocean; and, purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed\r\n                        from land.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I cannot guess how many days have passed since then; but I have endured\r\n                        misery, which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\r\n                        burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged\r\n                        mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder\r\n                        of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But again the frost\r\n                        came, and made the paths of the sea secure.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">By the quantity of provision which I had consumed I should guess that I had\r\n                        passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope,\r\n                        returning back upon the heart, <tei-pb n=\"[3.150]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/150.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> often wrung bitter drops of despondency\r\n                        and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I\r\n                        should soon have sunk beneath this misery; when once, after the poor animals\r\n                        that carried me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice\r\n                        mountain, and one sinking under his fatigue died, I viewed the expanse\r\n                        before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the\r\n                        dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be, and uttered a\r\n                        wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge, and the distorted\r\n                        proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! with what a burning gush did\r\n                        hope revisit my heart! warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped\r\n                        away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still\r\n                        my sight was dimmed by the <tei-pb n=\"[3.151 - page breaks after 'burn-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/151.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> burning drops, until, giving way to the\r\n                        emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead\r\n                        companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour's rest,\r\n                        which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I\r\n                        continued my route. The sledge was still visible; nor did I again lose sight\r\n                        of it, except at the moments when for a short time some ice rock concealed\r\n                        it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it; and when,\r\n                        after nearly two days' journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile\r\n                        distant, my heart bounded within me.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my enemy, my hopes were\r\n                        suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\r\n                        ever done before. A ground sea <tei-pb n=\"[3.152]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/152.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> was heard; the thunder of its progress,\r\n                        as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more\r\n                        ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea\r\n                        roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and\r\n                        cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon\r\n                        finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy,\r\n                        and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was continually\r\n                        lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died; and I\r\n                        myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress, when I saw your\r\n                        vessel riding at anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\r\n                        I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north, and was <tei-pb n=\"[3.153]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/153.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> astounded at the sight. I\r\n                        quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars; and by these means\r\n                        was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice-raft in the direction of\r\n                        your ship. I had determined, if you were going southward, still to trust\r\n                        myself to the mercy of the seas, rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to\r\n                        induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy. But your\r\n                        direction was northward. You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted,\r\n                        and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death,\r\n                        which I still dread,—for my task is unfulfilled.</tei-p>\r\n                     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Oh! when will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, allow me\r\n                        the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?

Yet, do I dare ask you to undertake my pilgrimage,\r\n                        to endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet,\r\n                        when I am dead, if he should appear; if the ministers of vengeance should\r\n                        conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not\r\n                        triumph over my accumulated woes, and live to make another such a wretch as\r\n                        I am.

Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\r\n                     delirium: he believes, that, when in dreams he holds converse with his friends,\r\n                     and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries, or excitements to\r\n                     his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the real\r\n                     beings who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a\r\n                     solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and\r\n                     interesting as truth.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and <tei-pb n=\"[3.159 - page breaks after 'mis-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/159.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                     misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded\r\n                     knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension.

My feelings are profound;\r\n                        but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious\r\n                        achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me, when\r\n                        others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away in\r\n                        useless <tei-pb n=\"[3.160]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/160.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> grief those talents\r\n                        that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I\r\n                        had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\r\n                        animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this\r\n                        feeling, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves\r\n                        only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as\r\n                        nothing; and, like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in\r\n                        an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and\r\n                        application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the\r\n                        idea, and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect,\r\n                        without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in\r\n                        my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of <tei-pb n=\"[3.161]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/161.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> their effects. From my\r\n                        infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I\r\n                        sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not\r\n                        recognize me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my\r\n                        heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again\r\n                        to rise.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Must I then lose this admirable being?

They desired, therefore, that I\r\n                     should engage with a solemn promise, that if the vessel should be freed, I\r\n                     would instantly direct my course southward.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This speech troubled me.

The ice cracked\r\n                     behind us, and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprung from\r\n                     the west, and on the 11th <tei-pb n=\"[3.173]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/173.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the\r\n                     passage towards the south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this, and\r\n                     that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of\r\n                     tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued.\r\n                        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Frankenstein</tei-persName>, who was dozing, awoke, and asked the\r\n                     cause of the tumult. <tei-said who=\"#walton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"They shout,\"</tei-said> I said, <tei-said who=\"#walton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"because they will soon return to <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002445\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">England</tei-placeName>.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Do you then really return?\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#walton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Alas! yes; I cannot withstand their demands.

At length he opened his eyes, but he breathed with difficulty, and was\r\n                     unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught, and ordered us to\r\n                     leave him undisturbed. In the mean time he told me, that my friend had not many\r\n                     hours to live.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve, and be patient. I sat by\r\n                     his bed watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\r\n                     presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and, bidding me come near,\r\n                        said—<tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Alas! the strength I relied on is gone; I feel\r\n                        that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in\r\n                        being. Think <tei-pb n=\"[3.175]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/175.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> not,\r\n                           <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Walton</tei-persName>, that in the last moments of my existence I\r\n                        feel that burning hatred, and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but\r\n                        I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these\r\n                        last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find\r\n                        it blameable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational\r\n                        creature, and was bound towards him, to assure, as far as was in my power,\r\n                        his happiness and well-being. This was my duty; but there was another still\r\n                        paramount to that. My duties towards my fellow-creatures had greater claims\r\n                        to my attention, because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\r\n                        misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\r\n                        create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\r\n                        and selfishness, in <tei-pb n=\"[3.176]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/176.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> evil:\r\n                        he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed\r\n                        exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst\r\n                        for vengeance may end. Miserable himself, that he may render no other\r\n                        wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have\r\n                        failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to\r\n                        undertake my unfinished work; and I renew this request now, when I am only\r\n                        induced by reason and virtue.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#victor\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends,\r\n                        to fulfill this task; and now, that you are returning to <tei-placeName type=\"tgn\" key=\"7002445\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"key type\">England</tei-placeName>, you will have little chance\r\n                        of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well\r\n                        balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my <tei-pb n=\"[3.177 - page breaks after 'judg-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/177.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\r\n                        judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death.

That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\r\n                        other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only\r\n                        happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.

About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak, but was\r\n                     unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the\r\n                     irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his\r\n                        lips.<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Margaret</tei-persName>, what comment can I make on the untimely\r\n                     extinction of this glorious spirit?

Again; there is a sound as\r\n                     of a human voice, but <tei-pb n=\"[3.179]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/179.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> hoarser;\r\n                     it comes from the cabin where the remains of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Frankenstein</tei-persName>\r\n                     still lie.

I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it;\r\n                     yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and\r\n                     wonderful catastrophe.</tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\r\n                     friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe; gigantic in\r\n                     stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the\r\n                     coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand\r\n                     was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he\r\n                     heard the sound of my <tei-pb n=\"[3.180 - page breaks after 'ap-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/180.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> approach, he ceased to utter exclamations\r\n                     of grief and horror, and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision\r\n                     so horrible as his face, of such loathsome, yet appalling hideousness. I shut\r\n                     my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with\r\n                     regard to this destroyer.

I approached this\r\n                     tremendous being; I dared not again raise my looks upon his face, there was\r\n                     something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but\r\n                     the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and\r\n                     incoherent self-reproaches.

I recollected my threat,\r\n                        and resolved that it should be accomplished.

Urged thus far, I had no choice but to\r\n                        adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion\r\n                        of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended;\r\n                        there is my last victim!\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to\r\n                     mind what <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Frankenstein</tei-persName> had said of his powers of eloquence\r\n                     and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\r\n                     friend, indignation was re-kindled within me. <tei-said who=\"#walton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Wretch!\"</tei-said> I said, <tei-said who=\"#walton\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"it is well that you come here\r\n                        to whine over the desolation that you have made. You throw a torch into a\r\n                        pile of buildings; and when they are consumed you sit among the ruins, and\r\n                        lament the fall. <tei-pb n=\"[3.185 - page breaks after 'Hypo-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/185.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> Hypocritical fiend! if he whom you mourn\r\n                        still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey of\r\n                        your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only\r\n                        because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your\r\n                     power.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"Oh, it is not thus—not thus,\"</tei-said> interrupted the\r\n                     being; <tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"yet such must be the impression conveyed to you\r\n                        by what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a\r\n                        fellow-feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first\r\n                        sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and\r\n                        affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be\r\n                        participated. But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that\r\n                        happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what\r\n                        should I seek for <tei-pb n=\"[3.186 - page breaks after 'sym-']\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/186.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> sympathy? I am content to suffer alone,\r\n                        while my sufferings shall endure: when I die, I am well satisfied that\r\n                        abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed\r\n                        with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to\r\n                        meet with beings, who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the\r\n                        excellent qualities which I was capable of bringing forth. I was nourished\r\n                        with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now vice has degraded me\r\n                        beneath the meanest animal. No crime, no mischief, no malignity, no misery,\r\n                        can be found comparable to mine. When I call over the frightful catalogue of\r\n                        my deeds, I cannot believe that I am he whose thoughts were once filled with\r\n                        sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.\r\n                        But it is even so; <tei-pb n=\"[3.187]\" facs=\"pageImages/vol3/187.jpg\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> the\r\n                        fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\r\n                        had friends and associates in his desolation; I am quite alone.\"</tei-said></tei-p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-said who=\"#creature\" data-origname=\"said\" data-origatts=\"who\">\"You, who call <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Frankenstein</tei-persName> your\r\n                        friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But, in\r\n                        the detail which he gave you of them, he could not sum up the hours and\r\n                        months of misery which I endured, wasting in impotent passions. For whilst I\r\n                        destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever\r\n                        ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still\r\n                        spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only\r\n                        criminal, when all human kind sinned against me?
